The piebald sniffed at the honeycomb, then jerked up its head to watch
him suspiciously. He didn't move. After a moment it took the honeycomb.

When he threw another bit, the piebald hippogriff wheeled away, but
returned almost at once and ate it. Johnny tossed a third piece only a
few yards from where he was sitting.

It was bigger than the others, and the hippogriff had to bite it in two.
When the hippogriff bent its head to take the rest Johnny was on his
feet instantly, swinging his lariat. He dropped the noose over the
hippogriff's head. For a moment the animal was too startled to do
anything; then Johnny was on its back, clinging tight.

The piebald hippogriff leaped into the air, and Johnny clamped his legs
about convulsed muscles. Pinions whipped against his knees and wind
blasted his eyes. The world tilted; they were rushing downward. His
knees pressed the sockets of the enormous wings.

The distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall
upward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff's
talons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug
heels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his
teeth.

The universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath
into his lungs. Then they plunged again. Wind searched under his shirt.
Once he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the
feather-mane.
