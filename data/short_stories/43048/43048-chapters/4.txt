He woke with a start, suddenly cold: the setting sun was below his
island. The feathery odor was still on his hands. He looked around for
the hippogriff and saw it sniffing at his pack.

When it saw him move, it trotted up to him with an expectant air. He
threw his arms about the great flat-muscled neck and pressed his face
against the warm feathers, with a faint sense of embarrassment at
feeling tears in his eyes.

"Good old Patch," he said, and got his pack. He shared the last piece of
honeycomb with his hippogriff and watched the sun sink still further.
The clouds were turning red.

"Let's go see those clouds," Johnny said. He mounted the piebald
hippogriff and they flew off, up through the golden air to the sunset
clouds. There they stopped and Johnny dismounted on the highest cloud of
all, stood there as it turned slowly gray, and looked into dimming
depths. When he turned to look at the world, he saw only a wide smudge
of darkness spread in the distance.

The cloud they were standing on turned silver. Johnny glanced up and saw
the moon, a crescent shore far above.

He ate an apple and gave one to his hippogriff. While he chewed he gazed
back at the world. When he finished his apple, he was about to toss the
core to the hippogriff, but stopped himself and carefully took out the
seeds first. With the seeds in his pocket, he mounted again.

He took a deep breath. "Come on, Patch," he said. "Let's homestead the
moon."
