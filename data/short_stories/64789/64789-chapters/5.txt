When Autumn returned, Ben Gascon was on the air again after all. His
sponsors feared that his marriage to Shannon Cole might damage their
popularity as co-stars, but radio fans showed quite the opposite
reaction. Gascon introduced a fresh note in the form of a new dummy,
which he named Jack Duffy, a green-horn character with a husky voice
instead of a shrill one and rural humor instead of cocktail-hour
repartee.

Sometimes people asked what had become of Tom-Tom; but Gascon always
managed to change the subject, and eventually Tom-Tom was forgotten.
