Klon dropped from the side of the ship.

He paused for a moment over the lifeless bodies of the three intrepid
explorers, then moved away, disgusted by his closeness to the horrible
creatures he had slain so swiftly and casually.

His every sense was alert for the slightest movement on the long
gleaming thing beside him to retaliate in quick vengeance for the
slaying of the things that lived within its belly.

Klon crouched there for moments, then moved toward the ship. He climbed
into the port entrance, leaving a thick trail of slime in his wake. He
moved eagerly toward the small hole in the opposite wall, his heart
thudding with bursting eagerness.

He had seen Frank Barker slip the shield over the shadow that was so
unlike anything on his earth. And now he moved through the darkness of
the space ship, slipping surely through a darkness that was natural to
him and his fellow creatures.

He lifted the small box from its recess, turned and sped from the ship,
vague terror and superstition overcoming the courage that had taken
so long to build to a white heat. He rushed past the men who slept
the eternal sleep before the port of their ship, slipped into the
warm water at the edge of the clearing, began his long journey to the
meeting place at which a leader would be chosen.

He clasped the box close to him as he raced through the swampy jungle,
afraid that it might disappear before he could reach his destination.
He did not pause to examine his prize, knowing that the time was
growing short, feeling certain a longer wait would only make the globe
of lightness more thrilling.
