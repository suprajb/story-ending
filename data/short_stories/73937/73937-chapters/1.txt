I got out of the taxi at the foot of the hill. Ozoneff's home was at
its summit, surrounded by a garden that threatened to pullulate into
unproper Bostonian jungle at any moment. As I walked up the brick
pathway toward the house, between flowering trees that hinted the
presence of tigers, the gardener stepped out to block my way. He was
dressed in earth-stained overalls and wore gloves; a desiccated man
tall and lean as a mystery figure in a Navaho sand-painting. He held
before him, like a twin-handled short-sword, a pair of hedge-shears.
"Good morning," I said, sucking my belt-buckle back from the points of
the clippers. "I have an appointment to see Dr. Ozoneff."

"Indeed?" The gardener raised his sharp chin and stared at me like
an entymologist inspecting an impudent bed-bug. "At what time had the
master consented to see you, sir?"

I felt that the gardener's "sir" had a pejorative tone to it,
pronounced the way it would be pronounced by an injured enlisted man
speaking to his injuring officer. "Dr. Ozoneff will see me at ten
o'clock," I said. "Put aside those clippers and let me pass. I shall
certainly inform the doctor of your behavior."

He held me at bay with the shears. "I assure you, sir, that the master
will neither see you nor hear ill of me," he said. "Be that as may,
you're early. It is not yet nine-forty-five. I can't allow you to burst
in on the master betimes. Perhaps you'll wait here in the garden?"
