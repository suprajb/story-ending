When Mystiffio finished his routine I took Morry backstage. I found
Alice.

"Here she is, Morry," I said. "And she's just as nice as she looks." I
shoved Alice toward him. "Be nice, baby," I hissed in her ear.

Morry took one of her little hands and his eyes were interested.

"I kinda like the act," he said. "If you could find time to be nice to
me I might like it a whole lot."

Alice takes her hand back as if it had accidentally brushed something
slimy.

"I'm sorry but I don't go with the act," she snapped. "There are some
things worth more to me than three meals a day and a paycheck."

"Okay, sister," Morry said without expression. He turned to me. "Guess
I made a mistake coming up here. The act is lousy."

"Now wait a minute," I yelled. "You said it was good. You can't walk
out now." I wheeled to Alice. "Baby, baby, don't do this to me. Tell
him you're sorry."

Mystiffio came up behind us while we were talking.

"What is the matter?" he asked. I noticed he put an arm around Alice's
shoulders. I was too distraught to think about it.

"Nothing's wrong," I said desperately. "Alice just took offense at
something Morry said. Nobody meant any harm."

Mystiffio drew himself up straight and he grabbed Morry by the lapels.
Morry struggled to free himself but he was pinioned helplessly.

"You cad! You bounder!" Mystiffio roared. "Do you mean you've been
making advances to my daughter?"

Daughter! How do you like that! That just goes to show you never to
trust people.

Morry pulled himself loose.

"You're all crazy," he shouted. "Lemme out of here."

He wheeled and started away, but before he had taken two strides he
collided with a solid, unyielding, invisible substance.

He backed away a few steps, his mouth working in terror.

"What is it?" he screamed.

"I'm sorry," Horatio's voice sounded in the air a few feet from Morry.

Morry's face went white; he stared wildly about for another instant
and then charged madly out of the theatre, screaming in terror.
