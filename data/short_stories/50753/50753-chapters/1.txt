The Archeologist regarded him quizzically. "I'm pleased that you should
think of me and my work, and I'm very happy to see you again. But admit
it now, isn't there something a bit odd about your getting so worked
up over this thing? I can understand that after your long absence from
Earth, any news of Earth would seem especially important. But isn't
there an additional reason?"

The Explorer twisted impatiently. "Oh, I suppose there is.
Disappointment, for one thing. We were hoping to get in touch with
intelligent life out there. We were specially trained in techniques for
establishing mental contact with alien intelligent life forms. Well, we
found some planets with life upon them, all right. But it was primitive
life, not worth bothering about."

Again he hesitated embarrassedly. "Out there you get to thinking of
the preciousness of intelligence. There's so little of it, and it's so
lonely. And we so greatly need intercourse with another intelligent
species to give depth and balance to our thoughts. I suppose I set
too much store by my hopes of establishing a contact." He paused. "At
any rate, when I heard that what we were looking for, you had found
here at home--even though dead and done for--I felt that at least it
was something. I was suddenly very eager. It is odd, I know, to get
so worked up about an extinct species--as if my interest could mean
anything to them now--but that's the way it hit me."
