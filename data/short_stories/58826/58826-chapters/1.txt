Out of a million evolutionary possibilities in a Universe of planets,
the chances of two intelligent races being even roughly similar are
astronomically remote.

A being develops sense organs for no other reason than to make it aware
of its environment. The simplest primitive being's awareness of its
environment centers around food, its means of survival. It develops
organs and appendages that will enable it to ferret out, obtain and
ingest its food. As the food differs, so, then, does the eater.

The Travelers had no ears or eyes, as such. They had other organs for
other purposes, but the net result was that they "saw" and "heard"
quite as well--even better--than Earthmen.

Perhaps that explains why the Travelers gleaned so much more from the
tape recording in the Twentieth Century capsule than its originators
had planned or intended.
