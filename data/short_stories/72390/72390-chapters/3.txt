That spring, the rains were soft and warm and the flowers grew
riotously upon the face of the earth. Grass knew a greenness it had
never known before, and trees dressed each day in lovelier and lovelier
dresses. The rains fell in the cities and on the plains. In valleys and
in little towns. On fields and forests and lawns. And when the land had
drunk its fill, the sun came out as warm and as bright as Rosemary's
hair, and the sky turned as blue as her eyes.

Yes, you know Rosemary, and you are in love with her in a way. If you
are not, you should be. She is the sun coming up in the morning and
the sun going down at night. She is the gentle rain against your face
in spring. She is the snow falling on Christmas Eve. She is every
glorious rainbow you see in the rain-washed sky. She is that pattern
of tree-shade over there. Each morning, when you are lying fast asleep
in your trundle bed, she tiptoes into your room, her golden sandals
soundless on the bedroom floor, and wakes you with a golden kiss.
Sunlight is her laughter, her voice the patter of the rain--Soft you
now!--she speaks:

    _I am the daughter of the earth and water,
    And the nursling of the sky;
    I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
    I change, but I cannot die...._
