                         THE MANY-SIDED BALZAC


Honoré Balzac, or de Balzac, as he loved to call himself--though really
there was no “noble” blood in his veins--was baptized under the name
of Balssa. He was born on May 20, 1799, at Tours. His mother, Laure
Sallambier, was a Parisian; his father, a provincial from Languedoc.
After completing his studies in Paris, Honoré began the study of law
at the age of seventeen, but after eighteen months’ apprenticeship to
an attorney and a second year and a half’s service to a notary, his
literary ambition began to turn him away from the law. Already at the
age of twenty he had conceived the idea of a drama on Cromwell, but
after fifteen months’ labor, he read it to a company of friends who
received it coldly. In 1822, he made his first essay at the novel,
under the title, _The Inheritress de Birague_. From this time on
he labored incessantly in producing the gigantic works which have
immortalized his name.

Debt was always threatening to overwhelm Balzac, for in the days of
his largest income his free life and passion for luxuries kept him
constantly in danger of going down in the flood. Once, in 1825, when
his first novels produced but little return, he felt compelled to
leave his vocation of letters to become bookseller, printer, and
type-founder. But after three years of disaster, resulting in one
hundred thousand francs of debt, he once more took up his pen, this
time to succeed most splendidly--though it required ten years of
strenuous, almost frenzied, production to clear him of his obligations.

The story of his loves is closely knit with his literary career, as are
also the records of his minglings with the men of his day, but no such
brief monograph as this can even refer adequately to the details of his
personal life. Inspiration, observation, and labor were its dominant
notes throughout. Two thousand distinct characters move as in life
through his forty-seven volumes of more than sixteen thousand aggregate
pages, all produced in twenty-five years of actual pen-craft. What a
monument for the titan who in 1850 passed away in his prime!
