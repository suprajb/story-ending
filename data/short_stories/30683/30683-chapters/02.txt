"Even without the benefit of past thoughts," Gordon was saying, whacking
off a weed a yard away and nearly upsetting himself, "a mind with
nothing to do but think could accomplish miracles. Suppose it was not
aware of any other thinking entity, though it might be surrounded by
such similar entities. It would be born or come into existence some way,
arrive at self-awareness and certain other awarenesses to base its
thinking on, depending on its structure, and--" he looked up at Harold
startled at his own conclusion--"it might even arrive at the ultimate
solution to all reality and comprehend the foundations of the Universe!"

"And eventually be destroyed without any other entity having the
benefit of it all," Harold commented dryly.

"What a pity that would be," Gordon murmured. "For the human race to
struggle for hundreds of years, and have some unguessable entity on Mars
do all that in one lifetime--and it all go to waste while some
blundering ass lands on Mars and passes it by, looking for artifacts."
