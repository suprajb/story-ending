"I implied no such thing as atheism," Ont insisted. "I merely said that
the reasoning used by the ancients to arrive at the Creator was the most
slipshod and illogical possible. There was another line used long ago
that was more solid, but still very weak. It started out with the
statement, 'I can be aware of nothing but thoughts.' External stimuli,
if such there are, must be transformed into thought before I can be
aware of them. Since I can never be aware of anything other than
thought, why assume anything except thought exists? You, and all other
things, exist as thoughts in my mind. There is nothing except what
exists in my mind. Therefore, by that token, _I_ am God!"

"But," Upt chuckled, "by the same token I can insist that _I_ am God and
you are just a product of my own creation."

"Yes," Ont agreed. "So it presents a dilemma. To resolve it, it is
necessary to postulate a Supreme Mind, and to say that all things are
just thoughts in God's Mind. That makes us both the same then and there
is no argument about who is God!"
