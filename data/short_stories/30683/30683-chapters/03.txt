"But that is only the start in the blunders contained in that most
profound philosophical revelation of old," Ont stated. "After arriving
at a precarious conclusion about existence the ancients were not
satisfied. They had to say, 'If I am I must have been created!' Then
they go on and say, 'If I was created there must be a Creator!' And thus
they soar from their precarious perch in existence, soar on nonexistent
wings, and perch on the essence of evanescence! They do not recognize
the alternative--that to exist does not necessarily imply a beginning.
They do not recognize it because they have derived all their tools from
reality around them and then denied the reality while accepting the
validity of the tools of thought derived from it. And in this way they
arrive at an absolute existence of Something they have never sensed or
felt in any way, while denying all that they have felt and sensed, and
give it attributes which their sense of idealism dictates it must have,
and call it God."

"Then," Upt said thoughtfully, "I take it you are an atheist?"

"Certainly NOT," Ont growled telepathically.

"But you implied that in your comments on the conclusions of the
ancients," Upt insisted.
