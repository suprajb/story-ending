Gordon and Harold paused at the edge of the garden.

"Nice crop of vegetables you have there, Gordon," Harold said
appreciatively.

"Thanks," Gordon said. "Say, wouldn't your wife like some fresh
vegetables?"

Without waiting for an answer he stepped back into the garden, taking a
knife from his pocket.

"These are nice now," he said, bending over and cutting. "Won't be much
longer though. Brown spots developing already. I'll scrape off the brown
stuff for you, but tell your wife to cook them right away. In a couple
of days they'll spoil."
