"There must be some way," Gordon said. "I've taught logic at the U for
fifteen years now, and I've done a lot of thinking on the subject. If we
ever reach Mars I think we should be very careful what we touch. We
would be clumsy bulls in a china shop, not knowing the true worth of
what we found, destroying what might be found to be priceless by later
and more careful explorers. Mars is older than the Earth, and I can't
help being convinced that there is SOME form of intelligence there."
