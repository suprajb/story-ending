Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman
out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his
flattened, red face.

"New prisoner asking to see you personal," Keller reported. "Told him
no. Okay?"

"No," I said. "He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He
isn't violent, is he?" I asked in some concern. The room was still in
disarray.

"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important."

"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he
is?"

"One of the Committee--Councilman Coleman."

"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?"

"Councilman Coleman."

I whistled. "What did they nail him on?"

"Misuse of authority."

"And he didn't get a suspended for that?"

"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?"

I gave a lateral wave of my hand. "Of course."

My pattern of living--call it my office routine--had been
re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much
over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now
I could think.

Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior
attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.

"Sit down, Councilman," I directed.

He deigned to comply.

I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman
had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his
friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached
from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every
transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more
than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for
deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,
Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal
sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him
first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland.
