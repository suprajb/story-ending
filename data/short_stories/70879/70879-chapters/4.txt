None look now in the mirrors of Tuzun Thune. The pleasure boats shun
the shore where stands the wizard's house and no one goes in the
house or to the room where Tuzun Thune's dried and withered carcass
lies before the mirrors of illusion. The place is shunned as a place
accursed, and though it stands for a thousand years to come, no
footsteps shall echo there. Yet Kull upon his throne meditates often
upon the strange wisdom and untold secrets hidden there and wonders....

For there are worlds beyond worlds, as Kull knows, and whether the
wizard bewitched him by words or by mesmerism, vistas did open to the
king's gaze beyond that strange door, and Kull is less sure of reality
since he gazed into the mirrors of Tuzun Thune.
