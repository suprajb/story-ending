I went to the church to see that everything was in apple-pie order. I
left Hank wandering in a sort of daze, impressed on him the necessity
of being there at eleven sharp, told him to take a drink and stop
looking like Sydney Carton, and wondered if he'd stop the ceremony to
tell the preacher his words were unreasonable.

Time zipped by. The guests began to arrive. The organist came in and
started practicing. The preacher came. Helen arrived, surrounded by a
bevy of chattering bridesmaids. But no Hank. I called the apartment;
the phone continued to laugh at me. Dr. MacDowell came back to the
vestry room and pouted,

"Where is he, Jim? It's getting near eleven."

"He must be on his way," I said hopefully.

But eleven came--and still no Hank. And then it was eleven-fifteen, and
eleven-thirty, and people were beginning to cough and get restless. One
of the bridesmaids got hysterical. Helen shot Emily Post to the four
winds and came to me in the vestry room almost in tears.

"Jim," she pleaded, "he's not here! He must have been hurt or
something. Can't you find out?"

"I'll try," I told her. She left, and her old man came in. He was
upset, and I don't mean he had a hangover. His eyes bulged like bumps
on a cucumber.

"Blakeson," he bellowed, "where's Cleaver?"

"Do I look like a crystal ball?" I snarled. "Sit tight and amuse the
crowd with card tricks. I'm going out to find him." And I went ... but
somehow I had a feeling that it was a futile gesture.
