So I did. I found Horse-sense Hank poking around in his south forty and
told him what I wanted. He didn't answer for so long that I thought
maybe the shock had killed him.

I asked anxiously, "Well, Hank? What's the word?"

"Turnips," he said mournfully, "is hell. It don't matter where you
plant 'em or how careful. They never do what you expect. Oh, you mean
about the University? Well, I don't guess it would do no harm. I'll go
if you want me to."

"I do," I told him with savage satisfaction. "All my life I've wanted
to see what would happen when a man with plain, ordinary horse-sense
crossed gray matter with a bunch of animated reference books. You're
the party of the first part. Look, Hank--suppose you were out hunting
with another guy. You see the flash of his gun; ten seconds later you
hear the boom. How far away from him are you?"

"A game, mebbe?" asked Hank. He pondered for a minute while I waited,
wondering if I'd cleaned the machine the first time or if this were a
perpetual jackpot.

Then, "How cold is it?" asked Hank.

I almost yelped with joy. "Say about sixty-eight," I said.

Hank said, "Well, then, I reckon he'd be 'bout two mile off. Trifle
more, mebbe."

"Why?" I demanded. "How did you know?"

Hank looked perplexed. He said, "Well, it seems as if. That's all."

"And _that_," I told him, "is all I wanted to know! Come on, my friend.
Let's go puzzle pedagogues!"
