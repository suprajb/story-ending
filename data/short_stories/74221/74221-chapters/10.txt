"Our observations, Hank, also indicate that in this universe, every
other galaxy is running away from ours as fast as it can. Why is this?"

Cleaver repeated unbelievingly, "Runnin' away?"

"Yes. Our spectroscopes show a 'red shift' in the apparent motion of
all stars. This proves that the universe is expanding--"

"Why, no!" said Hank. "Gosh, no!"

"_No?_"

"Why, you got it all backward," explained Horse-sense Hank. "What
you're sayin' ain't reasonable. Truth of the matter is, the universe
ain't expandin' at all. It's just a-standin' still. Reason things look
thataway to us is because--we're contractin'!"

And that really _did_ stop them! Even when Hank explained that the same

a gigantic room while the walls receded, as would be visible to a man
_shrinking_ in the middle of a normal-sized room. They didn't get it,
