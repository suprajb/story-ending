The only thing stuffier than the office of H. Logan MacDowell, Midland
University's president, was H. Logan himself. Hank and I entered
the outer office, ran a gantlet of upturned noses, and were finally
informed by a pair of glinting pince-nez that "Dr. MacDowell will see
you now, if you please." We pleased.

Beauty and the Beast greeted us. H. Logan's daughter might be a
chippie off the old blockhead, but they look as much alike as me and
my passport picture. She smiled at us as we entered, and life was all
sugar and Santa Claus. Our pal the prexy lurched and wobbled in the
depths of his swivel-chair, gave it up as a bad job, motioned us to
seats and _hrrumphed_!

"Well, Blakeson, might I interrogate as to the reason for this
unexpected visitation?"

"If," I deciphered, "you mean why am I here, sure! This is an
unveiling. Take off your polysyllables, Doctor. You're in the presence
of genius."

"Genius?" MacDowell stared distastefully at Hank's mail-order suit and
bulldog shoes. "Genius?"

"When you say that," I advised, "grovel. You see before you, Doc, a man
deserving of the finest faculty position dear old M. U. has to offer.
Meet Hank Cleaver, the human slide rule!"
