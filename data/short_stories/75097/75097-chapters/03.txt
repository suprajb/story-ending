Jimmy made some rapid calculations.

Such a trip would require a capacity supply of gasoline and oil and a
landing on the flat might mean broken landing gear and a repair bill.

“I don’t see how I could do it for any less than a hundred dollars,” he
declared. “Of course if I could pick up a passenger there for the return
trip, I might do it cheaper.”

“I’ve only got fifty,” Weber said. “I’ve throwed up my job collecting
bills for the light company and bought enough grub to last for the trip,
and that’s all I’ve got left.”

The old man tried to hide his disappointment, but Jimmy saw his
shoulders sag and an expression of hopeless discouragement spread across
his face.

“I’m taking a chance of wrecking my plane,” he said, “but if I agree to
try the trip for fifty, will you agree to pay the repair bills if
anything should happen to the ship?”

“If we get there ahead of that rush, son, I’ll buy you a new ship,”
Weber promised. “You ain’t never seen a gold rush, have you?”

Jimmy admitted that he had not.

“But I’ve got the fever to see one,” he grinned. “If you’ll let me have
the fifty, I’ll get the Calico Peacock ready for the hop.”

“Where’s your aeroplane?” Weber asked. “Which one is it?”

Jimmy could detect no expression of disappointment in the old man’s face
when he pointed out the Calico Peacock. That pleased him, although he
knew that Weber had probably never been near an aeroplane before. Paying
half his hangar bill, Jimmy and one of the oil station attendants
trundled the Calico Peacock up to one of the gasoline sumps where it was
filled with gasoline and oil.

The old man’s luggage consisted of a heavy canvas sack filled with
provisions and a tarp-covered roll of blankets.

“If you’ve got any blankets ready, you’d better take them along,” he
advised Jimmy. “’Tain’t likely that we can get away from Keno until
tomorrow morning, so we’ll have to spend tonight under the open sky.”
