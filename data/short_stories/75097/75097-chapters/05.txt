When all their preparations were made, Jimmy helped his passenger into
the Calico Peacock and buckled a safety belt around him.

“Try to relax and take it easy,” he advised.

“You’re not goin’ to be scared any, are you?” the old man asked.

“Not until we start looking for a place to land, anyway,” Jimmy
answered.

“Wal, I’m goin’ to be up here with you. It ain’t goin’ to do me any good
to get scared if you ain’t, son.”

One of the field mechanics spun the stick of the Calico Peacock and a
few moments later, they taxied down to the runway and were off. Jimmy
swung the Calico Peacock out over the bay in a wide spiral, gaining
altitude until he could clear the east bay hills and cut across the
Sacramento Valley. The engine fired regularly for a while, but Jimmy
could see it was beginning to heat. Since he had overhauled it, Jimmy
had not been able to afford a long cross-country flight to get it
properly broken in. It was not surprising to him that it now began to
heat under a full throttle and a heavy load. He cut down his r.p.m. as
much as he dared and hoped that it would gradually cool. Instead, it
grew hotter.
