"Whew!" she gasped, sinking into a kitchen chair. "I've never been so
jittery in my life."

At the rear window of the kitchen, just over the cellar door, she heard
something, a kind of beating, flapping sound, but when she turned to
look through the window, there was nothing there.

"Brrr," she shuddered. "Someone must be walking over my grave."

She began to make a pot of tea to warm herself up. She was having her
second cup when the bright idea struck her.

"He'll be so grateful," she said, hurrying into the front hall to
search through the junk in the closet there. She hadn't liked the look
in his eyes when she'd last seen him. Perhaps he'd be so angry with her
that he'd leave, and then she'd have to refund what remained of the
five hundred dollars. This really gave her something to worry about.

"But," she half-sang to herself, taking out the box from the closet,
"this will make him change his mind. _Anyone_ would be grateful not to
have to sleep in a dirty old box like that another night...."
