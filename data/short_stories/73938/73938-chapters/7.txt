Being as silent as she could, she crept down into the cellar, and
cautiously opened the door of his room. The cot was still folded, up
against the wall.

"How strange," she said, entering the room. There was nothing there to
show the room's occupancy except his wooden box against the far wall
under the window.

"I wonder--" she said, half-aloud, "where he's gone to?"

At that moment, the sun went down, and the lid of the box opened up.

"Yipe!" said Mrs. Tibbets, as Vandor Thobal sat up in the box. His
hands arrested themselves in the process of brushing the soil from his
cloak.

"What are you doing in here!?" he demanded.

"What are _you_ doing _there_?" she countered, folding her arms.

Vandor swallowed, then seemed to think of something. "The mushrooms,"
he explained, rising to his awesome full height before her, the tiny
clods of earth rolling off his cloak back into the box. "They--They
need heat, you see. It's rather chilly here in the cellar at night, and
so, I've taken to sleeping in there, hoping my body heat will suffice
to help them grow."

"I never heard of such a thing!" said Mrs. Tibbets.

"Did you never hear of a chicken incubating an egg?" he said smoothly.

Mrs. Tibbets was taken aback at this. "Why--Yes, of course, but--"

"It's the same principle, really," he said, flashing his pointed teeth
in a wide smile at her.

"Yes--" she said, with a funny cold feeling inside her. "Yes, I suppose
it is."

Suddenly, without another word, she turned about and hurried upstairs.
She couldn't get the padlock on the door fast enough to suit her.
