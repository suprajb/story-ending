Mrs. Tibbets found herself smiling back, despite the queer goosefleshy
feeling she got all over when she saw the length and sharpness of his
canines. There was a numbing sort of heat in his deep-set, burning eyes
that made her feel rather weak and helpless.

"I'm afraid--" she said, and almost left those two words as her
complete statement, "--I'm afraid that I've rented all the rooms. I
just had the ad taken out of the paper today."

"Surely you have something ..." he insisted, coming inside her hall and
closing the door behind him. He made no move to remove his cloak. "All
I require is a place to sleep...."

"I'm so terribly sorry, but I--" Mrs. Tibbets began to worry about
Mister Thobal, all at once. What if she turned him away, and he were
found in the morning, huddled frozen in an alley somewhere. The fact
that it was mid-July didn't stop her mental image of frosty death.
Then she brightened. "Perhaps ... I wouldn't show this to anybody,
ordinarily, because it's really a terrible sort of place, but I _do_
have a very small room. However, I should warn you: It's down in the
cellar."

"Ah!" said Vandor Thobal, his eyes flashing scarlet. "Does it have
mice? Cobwebs? Mold?"

Mrs. Tibbets sighed, and nodded. "Yes, I'm afraid it does."

"Wonderful!" said the pale man. "I'll take it."

"You will?" she said, with considerable surprise.

"Yes. I'm--I'm a sort of nature-lover. We're all brothers, really. The
cat, the bat, the rat, the spider, the maggot...."

"Well," said Mrs. Tibbets, with a sniff, "it'll be like Old Home Week
for you in my cellar, then. It's this way," she said, leading him out
into the kitchen.
