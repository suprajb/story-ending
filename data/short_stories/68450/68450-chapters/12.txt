redeyed from journey by freight, at the camp near town--he having
hopped off, convenient.

“It’s Laramie! Whoopee! Thought you were in Kansas City.”

“So I was,” said Laramie; and he took mental note of the ravages of
time in that period of his absence. All the outfit had not come to
yet. “Howdy, Tex? Need a hand?”

Tex faced him.

“By jiminy! Out by passenger, back by freight! Or did you _walk_!
Busted, I’ll bet.”

“You win,” granted Laramie.

“What was it this time special? Liquor, cards or women?”

“Well, this time it was women,” Laramie confessed, shamed.

“I knowed it!” Tex vowed disgustedly. “I wont ask you where you’ve
been or what you’ve done. No use. Shore, you’ve a job. Your stuff is
just as you left it. Oh, heck!” groaned Tex, lapsing into the lingo.
“You fellers never l’arn nothin’. Easy come, easy go. You ought to
wear that for your brand.”

“Yep,” said Laramie, humble and crimson. “I never did have no sense.
I’m a shore brute. What hawss do I ride ag’in, fust?”
