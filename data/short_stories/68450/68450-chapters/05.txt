The virtuous Mr. Bunyan returned to his party.

“Did you discharge him, uncle?” one of the girls asked breathlessly.
“Wouldn’t he go?”

“He’ll stay till after the round-up. Was rather saucy about it. Said
he was going to quit anyhow. The sooner he quits, the better.”

“Independent, aye?” the younger man queried.

“Oh, it’s easy come, easy go, with these cowboys. He’s probably
saved his wages. No way to spend ’em, you see. So at first
opportunity he’ll lay off and blow ’em all in. That’s it. Then he’ll
be hunting another job. The same old story. I don’t worry.”

Laramie rode on, for a distance, alone. Thud of hoofs sounded. Happy
Jack drew in to pace him and be his partner for the afternoon’s last
circle.

“Say, Laramie, you aren’t goin’ to quit, are you?” Happy blurted.
“Sure not. Everybody knows you’re all right.”

“You bet I quit.”

“But you aint fired. Tex does the firing in this outfit, and you can
stay till your feet drop off.”

“Then I fire myself. ‘Brute’ and ‘ladies’ man,’ am I? I know when I
got enough, and I’m plump sick o’ ridin’. There’s no thanks to it.
There’s nothin’ to show but saddle-corns and rheumatics and a bad
reputation. What’s a puncher, outside o’ story papers? Yep, I’ve
made up my mind. I’ll quit at the shippin’-pens, when I aint needed.
I aim to sell my saddle and straighten out my legs, and never ride
no more. Mebbe I can live on my income,” he dourly added.

“Aw, Laramie!”

“I’ve said it. If you’re goin’ to talk, you can talk about the
weather.”
