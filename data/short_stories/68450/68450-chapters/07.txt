So Laramie Red was quitting! Considerable more remained to be said
upon the subject, chiefly among his mates. And the chantey welled
with drawl of chorus his-way directed:

    After the round-up’s over,
    After the shipping’s done,
    I’m going ho-ome, boys,
    Never more to roam.

Capped by the remindful--

    Gimme a platter o’ Lillian Russell,*
    Gimme a look at a skirt and a bustle,
    Then take my money and watch me hustle
    Back to the sage and sun!

[* Peaches and cream, of course!]

“Laramie wont get past the first stop with a ‘Last Chance’ sign over
a door,” they laughed. “What’ll you bet, Laramie?”

“I know that’s regulation with you-all,” Laramie answered soberly.
“Nope, I don’t bet. Can’t afford to, after only thirty year workin’
for grub. But you needn’t lay any plate for me. When I ride, I ride
in the cars. And, while you or’nary brute punchers are still ruinin’
hawsses, I’ll be eatin’ off French mee-noos and sleepin’ in a real
bed. Anybody who thinks I don’t mean it had better make me an offer
on my saddle. I’ve fired myself, and I’m done.”
