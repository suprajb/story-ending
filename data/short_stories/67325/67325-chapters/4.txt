When I awakened this time they were gone. My electric clock hummed
softly on the mantle, revealing the nonsensical information that less
than an hour had passed since my visitors first arrived.

I staggered to my feet, bracing myself against the thick air, but the
air was just ordinary, thin, substanceless air again. My hand dropped
to my right hip.

The tentacle was gone.

"Thank God!" I breathed, and for an instant my common sense tried to
insist that I had merely fallen asleep for a few minutes and dreamed
the whole fantastic sequence.

But no! Why would I be stark naked? And why were my clothes lying
ruined in my chair like bandages split with a huge razor?

I clenched my left fist and gained comfort from the reassuring pressure
of four fingers and a thumb in my palm. But then I stepped into my
bedroom and stood before my full-length mirror--where I have stood
rooted ever since.

And the question revolves in my brain, punctuated only by my profanity
and sobs of despair. How can I marry Betty now? How can I face her, let
alone marry her?

What woman on earth could bring herself to marry a man with no
navel ... and two heads?
