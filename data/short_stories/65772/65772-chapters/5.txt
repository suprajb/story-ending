The monbeast grinned, showing the eighty sharp-pointed teeth I knew it
possessed. "Sorry, I'm here to stay. I'm your brainchild, you know, so
I'll have to stick to you."

I gulped. "Stick to me?"

"Only figuratively," the monbeast said. "But I'll be around." He
cocked a bug-eye at me and said gravely, "We'd better get a few things
straight right from the start. One of them is that as far as you're
concerned, I'm as real as that bedpost."

"Real?" I tried to laugh that off, but the sound came out a little
weakly. "That's silly. You're just a product of my imagination."

"Am I?" the monbeast said.

He thrust the scaly face close to mine and yawned. Suddenly the room
became a turkish bath.

"Okay, okay," I said hastily, "turn it off."

Coolness came, and I breathed easier as the steam dissipated.

"Secondly, you're going to create bigger and better BEMs and make them
more convincing," the monbeast continued. "With all you writers turning
us loose, we can have a swell time in this world."

"But how can you?" I protested. "You said the readers wouldn't believe
in you, so you don't exist for them."

"Science-fiction is growing," the monbeast said. "Everyday more people
are getting to realize that there is more to the world than those
things they see around them. They believe what they read in love
stories and detective stories. Science-fiction is next."

"Suppose I don't want to create more BEMs?" I said. "Suppose I take up
saxophone playing or something and leave science-fiction alone."

"You can't stop writing it now, any more than a true fan can stop
reading it. The bug has bitten you." He smiled a piano keyboard of
teeth and continued, "Besides, I could be obliged to--er--inspire you
just a bit. But you just work along with me, and we'll both do fine."

So we did.
