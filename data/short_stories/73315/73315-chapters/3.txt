Word had been sent to City Marshal Pete Culder, who was out in his home
cabin. The messenger said that Rearing Bill from Buck Hill had come to
town. At least, the fellow had said he was Rearing Bill and acted as bad
as they make them. Culder promised to come right down, but he wasn’t
seen by any one on that hectic night.

After shooting up Court House Square the disturber went into saloons and
took tentative shots at bottles and glasses. Keen observers noticed that
he shot with accuracy. He held his biggest of revolvers with a free,
powerful grip which on the pull landed the lead slugs in whatever he
aimed at, whether tin lamp base or peak glass on a pyramid of glasses.

Rearing Bill shambled from saloon to saloon. On each circuit he became
more uproarious, more exacting in his demands; and when in the Happy
Medium a frightened bartender put out a half size whisky glass instead
of a double size according to the fashion set by Flat Face Dink, Rearing
Bill with a grizzly-like swipe of the muzzle of his gun knocked the
unfortunate liquor clerk senseless. He then stood, amused for an instant
by the spectacle of the poor devil sprawled limp on the floor.

“Heh!” Rearing Bill snarled. “Cheat me on m’ liquor, eh! Heh!”

He turned, surging to glare from sunken eyes at the white faced
onlookers. As he stared at them one by one they all shrank, watchful of
the swinging of the carelessly handled revolver, the drunken man’s
unsteady finger on the trigger, the hammer drawn back at full cock and
the big, powerful paw holding the barrel as steady as a mounted cannon.
