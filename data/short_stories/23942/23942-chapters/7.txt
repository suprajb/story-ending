And went out like a light.

Arth was shaking my arm. "Want another _mass_?"

The band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring
accompaniment.

    _In Muenchen steht ein Hofbraeuhaus!
    Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!_

At the _G'sufa_ everybody upped with their king-size mugs and drank each
other's health.

My head was killing me. "This is where I came in, or something," I
groaned.

Arth said, "That was last night." He looked at me over the rim of his
beer mug.

Something, somewhere, was wrong. But I didn't care. I finished my _mass_
and then remembered. "I've got to get my bag. Oh, my head. Where did we
spend last night?"

Arth said, and his voice sounded cautious, "At my hotel, don't you
remember?"

"Not very well," I admitted. "I feel lousy. I must have dimmed out. I've
got to go to the Bahnhof and get my luggage."

Arth didn't put up an argument on that. We said good-by and I could feel
him watching after me as I pushed through the tables on the way out.

At the Bahnhof they could do me no good. There were no hotel rooms
available in Munich. The head was getting worse by the minute. The fact
that they'd somehow managed to lose my bag didn't help. I worked on that
project for at least a couple of hours. Not only wasn't the bag at the
luggage checking station, but the attendant there evidently couldn't
make heads nor tails of the check receipt. He didn't speak English and
my high school German was inadequate, especially accompanied by a
blockbusting hangover.

I didn't get anywhere tearing my hair and complaining from one end of
the Bahnhof to the other. I drew a blank on the bag.

And the head was getting worse by the minute. I was bleeding to death
through the eyes and instead of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.
Believe me, _nobody_ should drink a gallon or more of Marzenbraeu.
