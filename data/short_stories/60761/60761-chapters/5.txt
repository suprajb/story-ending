The island, as he walked around its short margin, showed itself to be
definitely smaller. He paused again by the black rock. The moss was
lost now, under the water, and the crack was all but under as well. He
stood shielding his eyes against the wind-driven rain, peering across
at the still visible shore. The waves, he noted, were not extreme--some
four or five feet in height--which meant that the storm proper was
probably paralleling the land some distance out in the gulf.

He clenched his fists in sudden frustration. If only he had hung on to
the sailplane--or any decent-sized chunk of it! At least going into the
water then would have been a gamble with some faint chance of success.

He had nowhere else to go, after rounding the island. He went back to
the plant.

"Man," said the plant, "one of my people has been blown to shelter a
little downstream."

Calvin straightened up eagerly, turning to stare into the wind.

"You cannot see him," said the plant. "He is caught below the river
bend and cannot break loose against the force of the wind. But he is
close enough to talk. And he sends you good news."

"Me?" Calvin hunkered down beside the plant. "Good news?"

"There is a large tree torn loose from the bank and floating this way.
It should strike the little bit of land where we are here."

"Strike it? Are you positive?"

"There are the wind and the water and the tree. They can move only to
one destination--this island. Go quickly to the windward point of the
island. The tree will be coming shortly."

Calvin jerked erect and turned, wild triumph bursting in him.

"Good-by, man," said the plant.

But he was already plunging toward the downstream end of the island. He
reached it and, shielding his eyes with a hand, peered desperately out
over the water. The waves hammered upon his boots as he stood there,
and then he saw it, a mass of branches upon which the wind was blowing
as on a sail, green against black, coming toward him.
