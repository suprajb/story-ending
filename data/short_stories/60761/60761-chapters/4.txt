"There must be something that would give us a better chance than just
sitting here," said Calvin.

The plant did not answer.

"What are you thinking about?" demanded Calvin.

"I am thinking of the irony of our situation," said the plant. "You are
free to wander the water, but cannot. I can wander the water, but I am
not free to do so. This is death, and it is a strange thing."

"I don't get you."

"I only mean that it makes no difference--that I am what I am, or that
you are what you are. We could be any things that would die when the
waves finally cover the island."

"Right enough," said Calvin impatiently. "What about it?"

"Nothing about it, man," said the plant. "I was only thinking."

"Don't waste your time on philosophy," said Calvin harshly. "Use some
of that brain power on a way to get loose and get off."

"Perhaps that and philosophy are one and the same."

"You're not going to convince me of that," said Calvin, getting up.
"I'm going to take another look around the island."
