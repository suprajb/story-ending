_'Tis said that he who laughs last laughs best. The world who beat
a path to Peter Manton's door in anger because he built the Better
Mousetrap, returned to thank him anyway. You see, with mice being
hurled backwards in time, they lived and they died in the mad rat-race
in time. And America, for its trouble with more rodents than it could
stand for a short period, now reaps its reward. For America is free of
rats._
