Paul Asher woke up late. He had a confused recollection of a dream.
Something about a beautiful brunette giving him a backrub.

A look at the chrono sent the dream out of his head and he hurried
through shaving and dressing.

His car was waiting for him, engine idling, at the curb. He got in,
tossing his briefcase and topcoat ahead of him to the far side of the
front seat. His back began to itch, insistently, and he rubbed it
against the leather upholstery.

Paul adjusted the safety belt around him, and fastened it. Might as well
do it now, instead of having to fool around with it later. Damn that
itch, anyway! It was as if something were stuck to his skin--like a
sticking plaster....

The high-powered vehicle purred smoothly as it took a long, rising
curve. The road climbed steadily toward the mountaintop city ahead.

The scene was familiar.

The itching of his back spread and became a prickly feeling in the small
hairs at the nape of his neck.

He knew now that he was not alone in the car. He looked in the rear-view
mirror.

Naomi.

She was looking at him insolently, her wide red mouth in a half smile.

She said: "Just keep going, Sweetheart, as fast as you can."
