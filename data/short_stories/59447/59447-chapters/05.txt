Virginia held her hands to her face to shade her eyes as she looked
out the window. "What you can see of the city from here is all bright
with lights," she said, "but there's no one on the streets. Only some
robots. Everyone in the city must be in bed."

"That's the way it's been every night," he said. "Early to bed and
late to rise--they're an odd race. I've wondered what they do to pass
away the time. But what they're doing now is something you should be
doing--resting."

She turned away from the window. "I'm not sleepy. I keep thinking of
_The Cat_ out there waiting for us and how we might get to it if we
could only get hold of a blaster."

"Which we can't try to do until they come for us in the morning. Some
rest now might mean a lot then."

"All right, Bob." She went to him and sat beside him on his cot. "What
is it now--how much more time?"

"About three hours."

She leaned her head against him and he put his arm around her. "I guess
I am a little tired," she said. "But don't let me go to sleep."

"All right, Ginny."

"It's only three hours and never any more, if we aren't lucky in the
morning. And if we aren't lucky, I don't want to have wasted our last
three hours."
