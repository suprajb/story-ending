The guard leader dropped his arm, to give the last command to the
robots. Tal-Karanth's mind raced and he saw two things with vivid
clarity:

He saw the inexorable decline of Tharnar and the City continuing down
the centuries until the little spark that was left smouldered its last
and was gone. And he saw the way death would obliterate the wild and
savage beauty of the barbarian girl, knew that it would go when the
life went from her, to leave her with a beauty that would be colorless
by contrast, that would be like the beauty of a _lana_ blossom--or a
Tharnarian woman.

And he thought he could see the answer to the menace that faced Tharnar
and the City.

"_Dorend_--"

The guard leader's first word of command came. Tal-Karanth's finger
stabbed at one of the buttons along his desk. He shoved it down, to
deactivate the robot-executioners, and they were frozen in immobility
when the final word came:

"--_thendar!_"

He snapped the switch which connected him with the office of Security
Officer Ten-Quoth and said:

"Have the chains taken from the Terrans and see that they are given
comfortable and unguarded quarters. Tell them they have been pardoned
by the Supreme Executive and that they are free to leave Tharnar
whenever they wish."
