Krumbine cleared his throat. "Potshelter, I'm going to wind this up
fast. Miss Dough, could you transfer to this young man's hive?"

"Oh, yes, sir! Mine has an over-plus of Girls Next Door."

"Good. Mr. Rowe, there's a sky-pilot two levels up--look for the
usual white collar just below the photocells. Marry this girl and
take her home to your hive. If your Queen Mother objects refer her
to--er--Potshelter here."

He cut short the young people's thanks. "Just one thing," he said,
wagging a finger at Rowe. "Don't written any more letters."

"Why ever would I?" Richard answered. "Already my action is beginning
to seem like a mad dream."

"Not to me, dear," Jane corrected him. "Oh, sir, could I have the
letter he sent me? Not to do anything with. Not to show anyone. Just to
keep."

"Well, I don't know--" Krumbine began.

"Oh, _please_, sir!"

"Well, I don't know why not, I was going to say. Here you are, miss.
Just see that this husband of yours never writtens another."

He turned back as the contracting door shut the young couple from view.

"You were right, Potshelter," he said briskly. "It was one of those
combinations of mischances that come up only once in a billion billion
times. But we're going to have to issue recommendations for new
procedures and safeguards that will reduce the possibilities to one
in a trillion trillion. It will undoubtedly up the Terran income tax
a healthy percentage, but we can't have something like this happening
again. Every boy must marry the Girl Next Door! And the first-class
mails must not be interfered with! The advertising must go through!"

"I'd almost like to see it happen again," Potshelter murmured dreamily,
"if there were another Jane Dough in it."
