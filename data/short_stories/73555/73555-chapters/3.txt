The sheriff thanked them kindly and went back to his office, where he
locked the guns in his desk. Then he went over to the Prospect Saloon,
where he nailed up his other notice. Asher and his men didn’t take so
kindly to the idea. Some of them were openly belligerent, and it seemed
for a few moments that the sheriff had a tough job, but Asher took the
matter out of their hands.

“I suppose this thing only applies to me and my men, eh?”

“You’re supposin’ wrong, Pete; I’ve already collected from the Tumblin’
K.”

“You’ve collected from Bud Hickman?”

“Why not?”

“Oh, I jist wondered. But suppose we don’t give you our guns?”

The sheriff considered Pete calmly. Then:

“I’ve allus liked you, Asher. You’ve been a damn’ fool in lotsa ways, but
you’re jist human like the rest of us. I’ve posted my notice, and I wrote
it myself.”

“But jist suppose we refuse to give up our guns?”

“That,” said the sheriff calmly, “would be jist too damn’ bad.”

“Oh--” softly--“and if I should happen to want to leave town, you’d give
me back my gun?”

“Jist like the sign says, Pete.”

“All right; here’s mine. Take ’em off, boys. We don’t need ’em--now.”

The sheriff looked over the guns as he deposited them about his person; he
walked out, swinging the hammer in his hand.

“Don’t that beat hell?” laughed Pete.

“I’ll betcha somebody told him somethin’,” said a cowboy.

“I don’t like the idea of a moth eaten old sidewinder takin’ my gun away,”
complained a cowboy who was new to the country. “We’d ’a’ had some fun, if
we’d refused.”

“You’ve got a sweet idea of fun,” growled Pete. “That moth eaten old
sidewinder is jist thirty-two years old, and if we hadn’t turned them guns
over to him he’d jist about ruined the whole gang of us with his pet
Winchester. When you see ‘By order of Buck Brady,’ you better read the
upper part of it and act accordingly.”
