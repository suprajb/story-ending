You know, sometimes I think we misjudged McCleary. It takes a while to
get to know a guy like Mac. Maybe his Louie _is_ brighter than Johnny,
and maybe his chugmobile _is_ something terrific.

For the last few years, all on account of Mac, my two weeks in August
have really been well spent Beautiful! Why, from Mars City you can
see low-slung mountains in the distance and dunes of soft, red sand
stretching out to them. And the sunsets when you're standing on the
parapets of that delicate crystal city.... And, man, fishing in the
Grand Canal....

How do you get to Mars? There's probably a couple of agencies in your
own town. You can look them up in your phone book under "Vacation at
the Planets of Pleasure" or something like that. They might be a little
difficult to find, though.

You see, they're not very well advertised yet.
