The bodies were lying in a row beneath an overhanging ledge of
sandstone. They had burrowed deep into a miniature jungle of thick
leaved canal weeds, and it had taken him a long time to find them. The
gleam of four shiny new B-type spacesuits, less carefully concealed,
had finally ended the search. Kent and Ray had been busy this morning.

Standing where he was, Joe could look down the green and red dotted
slope and see the ashes of the picnic fire, the scatterings of food
that the night-crawling _nolls_ had found unpalatable. And, blown by
Mars' occasional winds--or taken by alien hands--to a spot only a few
feet from where it had been thrown away, was the scrap of paper with
his letterhead on it. The paper that he and Kent had marked up during
their discussion of tomorrow night's flight to _Aarn_, Callisto.

_If they didn't actually hear us talking_, Joe thought, _it was that
paper that started the whole thing._

He said loudly: "Are you here, _Uarnl_? You thought it was perfect,
didn't you? You thought you could repossess your bodies as the liner
went off-world. Well, look at this!"

With executival thoroughness, he blasted the four bodies into cinders.
