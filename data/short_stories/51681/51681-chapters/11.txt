So now I have my Holly, but every now and then I lie awake beside her
in a cold sweat. Harla could have guessed wrong. Just as Wallach and
Crandall had been wrong in assuming the red button would be warmer than
the green. Their reaction was as emotional as Harla's.

I hope Harla either forgives me or never finds out that I had to sound
sure of myself, and that I had to play on his emotions simply to get
him to take the fifty-fifty chance on his--hers--_our_ lives.

And I get to sleep only after I've convinced myself that it was more
than chance ... that somehow our feelings and emotions guided Harla
where logic and definition fail.

For right and left do not exist until terrestrial man defines them.
