Wallach stepped into the tension by saying, "So we didn't anticipate
alien life. But now we've got the problem of communicating with it."

Crandall didn't appear to notice my stiff reply. He said, "Confound it,
what's missing?"

"What's missing," I told him, "is some common point of reference."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning that I could define left from right to any semi-intelligent
human being who was aware of the environment in which we live."

"For example?"

I groped for an example and said, lamely, "Well, there's the weather
rule, valid for the northern hemisphere. When the wind is blowing on
your back, the left hand points to the low pressure center."

"Okay. But how about Venus? Astronomical information, I mean."

I shook my head.

"Why not?" he demanded. "If we face north, the sun rises on our right,
doesn't it?"

"Yes. Even in the southern hemisphere."

"Well, then. So it doesn't make any difference which hemisphere they're
in."

"You're correct. But you're also making the assumptions that Venus
rotates on its axis, that the axis is aligned parallel to the Earth's
and that the direction of rotation is the same."

"We know that Venus rotates!"

"We have every reason to believe so," I agreed. "But only because
thermocouples measure a temperature on the darkside that is too high
to support the theory that the diurnal period of Venus is equal to the
year. I think the latest figures say something between a couple of
weeks and a few months. Next, the axis needn't be parallel to anything.
Shucks, Crandall, you know darned well that the solar system is a
finely made clock with no two shafts aligned, and elliptical gears
that change speed as they turn."
