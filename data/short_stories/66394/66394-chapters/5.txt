It was night of the next day and the children sat playing parchesi.
Mrs. Tapping was knitting. Mr. Tapping, settled back in the platform
rocker, was reading the newspaper aloud, as was his custom. Outside,
Mr. Trask was in one field, and Mr. Maudsley was in the other; his
head was back in place, but only tied on--it was not the same; it
looked very dead, even though Jimmy and Stella had done their best.

"Any news?" asked Mrs. Tapping.

"Same old stuff. New taxes, one of them foreign countries talkin' big
and threatenin' war," said Mr. Tapping. "One thing here, though--they
found a fellow with his head cut off right in the middle of a city
street."

"My land! Not here in Akerstown?"

Mr. Tapping laughed. "Lord, no! Happened way down in New Orleans."
