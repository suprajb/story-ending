Outside the ship, the guards watched the airlock door.

"I wonder why Dr. Harris did that?" said a lieutenant.

"Who knows?" a sergeant replied.

They had seen the airlock open and close, but knowing that Harris was
still inside, they had thought little of it. Still, it was odd.

The airlock door swung open again. Harris stepped out, looking dazed.
The lieutenant ran toward him, and quickly the engineer explained what
had happened.

"You mean he's inside there? We've got to stop him!"

"It's too late," Harris said. "He didn't know that I was doing some
adjusting inside there. Go ahead and look."

The lieutenant went to the inner door of the airlock and peered in. The
whole inside of the ship was gone, vanished as though it had never been.

"I had just made a slight adjustment of the generator." Harris said
quietly. "The power field was cut down, so the projector field was
smaller. I'm afraid our spy simply projected the inside of the
spaceship out into the interstellar vacuum and left the hull behind."

He shook his head grimly. "Poor devil. He'll have quite a surprise in
store for him--unless he can live without air!"
