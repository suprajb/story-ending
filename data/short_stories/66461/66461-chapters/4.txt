I left the domestic tableau to resolve itself and sought my cabin. I
stayed there through the remainder of the heavy acceleration, but when
we went into free flight the Major dragged me out.

The party was still in full force with the three other girls doing
titivating push-offs from wall to wall, convoluting their lovely bodies
into incredible ballet formations which Daphne took keen delight
in disrupting with licentious hands--like a spoiled child pricking
colorful balloons. Each fiasco ended in shrieks of laughter and mock
combat, until the Major was snugged back in his hold-down strap,
promising to behave.

Frequently he would raise his arms and aim an imaginary rifle.
"Ka-chunk! Broke a leg that time. Ka-chunk! Right in the hip!" Then
he'd holler over at me, "Never gut-shoot 'em. Break a bone."

Annellica remained bored and indifferent to the revelry. She drank
sparingly and passed up a hundred opportunities to be alone with me.
She paid meticulous attention to her husband's wants with the quiet
efficiency and anticipation of a trained secretary, but I caught her
eyeing me with a most provocative, speculating look. My experience with
married virgins was too limited to interpret her glances.

All revolved around the Major. When he ate, we all ate. When he
over-drank and slept, we slept.

I never did discover which three nieces were supposed to be "mine."
None paid me any attention, and Daphne, much to my relief, never
insisted upon my activity in his Bacchanalian affairs.
