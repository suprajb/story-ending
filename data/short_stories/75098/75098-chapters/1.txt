Although the field supposedly was closed to all civilians, we boys in
time acquired certain privileges. The guards would look the other way
when we sneaked under the fence, and unless some high-up officer was
around, we had the run of the place as long as we kept out of mischief.

From some favorite vantage-point we were observers of the exciting life
that passed on the field. More than once we witnessed the result of a
mechanical defect or a cadet’s instant of panic or bad judgment in the
air. There would be a flash of hurtling wings in the sunlight; then a
heap of twisted metal and splintered wood and torn cloth on the
ground--and the ambulance racing out to collect its gruesome freight.

Or lying on our backs in the dusty grass, we watched the silvery specks
high above us as they dipped and soared and looped, or came fluttering
down in long, giddy tailspins. We knew the different makes of planes,
their horsepower, their speed, their dependability. We knew the names of
the instructors and cadets, and their nicknames. We knew each one’s
reputation for skill and daring.

The possibility that sometime we might be taken for an air ride
ourselves was a thing we often discussed. I would have given my right
arm gladly for such a chance. The cadets would promise us rides easily,
but when we approached anyone with real authority, we were summarily
dismissed and threatened with being chased off the field.
