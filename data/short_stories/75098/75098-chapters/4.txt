Suddenly the plane started back toward earth in a crazy, sickening rush,
and with a speed that all but tore me loose from my precarious perch. It
was surely all over with me, I decided, and shut my eyes, lost in a
horrible swirling nausea. But instinctively, I hugged the strut in a
regular death-grip. I dropped into bottomless abysses and suffered such
terrifically violent changes of direction that up-and-down and sideways
were all scrambled together into one hodgepodge of tipsy motion. When I
opened my eyes, I found that the earth and the sky had changed places in
an extraordinary sort of waltz they were dancing with each other, and
once it looked as if we were falling straight into the sun. After that I
kept my eyes tightly closed.

The pilots were testing out the ship, putting it through every stunt it
was capable of. Maneuvers which had looked so graceful and easy from the
ground left me feeling much as though I had been a handball swiftly
batted through the air by a company of playful giants. And when the
plane looped, I felt I was being whirled about at the end of a long
string, and that the string was slowly slipping out of my grasp. In
fact, my grasp on the axle was weakening. Terror-stricken, I screamed
again and again, but the wind wiped out my voice, and the men only four
feet above me might have been that many miles away for any chance they
had of hearing me.
