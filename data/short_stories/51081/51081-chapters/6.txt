Mr. Sims laughed. "You're mistaken, Mike. Uncle Nat wouldn't give the
doctor any money. He hasn't even got enough for himself."

"But he quit his job yesterday," said the boy.

Nat's voice cut in sharply. "That's enough from you. You know what they
say about little boys."

Mr. Sims looked steadily at Nat as though seeing him for the first
time. His cousin gazed back, half-sullen, half-defiant.

"It certainly didn't take you long to get your hands on the money," Mr.
Sims said. "It looks as if I can't die soon enough. But I still don't
see where Dr. Van Stoke comes into--"

Then suddenly there was no need to ask. The answer was clear on Nat's
tight, sullen face.

Mr. Sims turned to the others for help and froze as identical
expressions stared back coldly from each of them, piercing him with
their long-hidden envy of his success, their pent-up hatred of their
dependence on him.

A choking, frightened sound came from deep in Mr. Sims' throat. "For
God's sake! _How much did you pay him to put me away?_"

He jumped quickly off the parapet, knocking the little boy to the
ground, and hurled the hemlock into the fountain. He pushed his way
past them and started to run. Then the woven garment twisted about his
legs. He tried to lift it clear, but his foot caught in the hem and he
stumbled.

Nat was the first to move. He picked up the little toy dagger and fell
on the struggling man. Without hesitating, he plunged the knife between
Mr. Sims' shoulder blades and held it till the older man was still.
Then he stabbed again, without malice, without any emotion ... again
and again.... The blade made an odd ripping sound each time it pierced
the woven robe.

All of them looked away. One of the women leaned over the parapet, sick.
