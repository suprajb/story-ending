When he was finally done, Nat stood up and cleaned the knife on the
grass and then motioned them all back toward the palace.

Mr. Hoode met them as they walked through the foyer. "Ah, Socrates'
friends!" he said to Nat, who was dabbing at the front of his coat with
a piece of tissue. "Was everything in order?"

"There was a slight change of plan," Nat said. "He decided at the last
moment to make it Julius Caesar." He held the knife up in explanation.

"_Julius Caesar!_ But--"

But they were gone, filing out through the front door, the women
sobbing in their handkerchiefs. No one looked back.

The door hissed quietly shut. Mr. Hoode started at the sound and then
walked slowly into his office, seized by a cold, limp rage. From his
window, he could see them going down the driveway.

"Amateurs," he spat after them with deep disgust. "Damned, lousy,
unimaginative amateurs!"
