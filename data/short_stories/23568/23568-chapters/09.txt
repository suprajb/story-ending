For an instant there was a strange, humming sound deep inside Jimmy's
head, like the drowsy murmur of bees in a dew-drenched clover patch.
Then the voice droned on. "The Earth people are frightened by our ships
now, for their cruel wars have put a great fear of death in their
hearts. They watch the skies with sharper eyes, and their minds have
groped closer to the truth.

"To the Earth people our ships are no longer the fireballs of mysterious
legend, haunted will-o'-the-wisps, marsh flickerings and the even more
illusive distortions of the sick in mind. It is a long bold step from
fireballs to flying saucers, Jimmy. A day will come when the Earth
people will be wise enough to put aside fear. Then we can show ourselves
to them as we really are, and help them openly."

The voice seemed to take more complete possession of Jimmy's thoughts
then, growing louder and more eager, echoing through his mind with the
persuasiveness of muted chimes.

"Jimmy, close your eyes tight. We're going to take you across wide gulfs
of space to the bright and shining land of your birth."

Jimmy obeyed.

It was a city, and yet it wasn't like New York or Chicago or any of the
other cities Jimmy had seen illustrations of in the newspapers and
picture magazines.

The buildings were white and domed and shining, and they seemed to tower
straight up into the sky. There were streets, too, weaving in and out
between the domes like rainbow-colored spider webs in a forest of
mushrooms.
