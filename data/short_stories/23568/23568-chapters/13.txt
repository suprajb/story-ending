Uncle Al and Pigtail came out of the disk in an amazingly simple way.
They just seemed to float out, in the glimmering web. Then, suddenly,
there wasn't any disk on the river at all--just a dull flickering where
the sky had opened like a great, blazing furnace to swallow it up.

"I was just swimmin' along with Pigtail, not worryin' too much, 'cause
there's no sense in worryin' when death is starin' you in the face,"
Uncle Al muttered, a few minutes later.

Uncle Al sat on the riverbank beside Jimmy, staring down at his palm,
his vision misted a little by a furious blinking.

"It's gold, Uncle Al!" Pigtail shrilled. "A big lump of solid gold--"

"I just felt my hand get heavy and there it was, young fella, nestling
there in my palm!"

Jimmy didn't seem to be able to say anything.

"High school books don't cost no more than grammar school books, young
fella," Uncle Al said, his face a sudden shining. "Next winter you'll be
a-goin' to high school, sure as I'm a-sittin' here!"

For a moment the sunlight seemed to blaze so brightly about Uncle Al
that Jimmy couldn't even see the holes in his socks.

Then Uncle Al made a wry face. "Someday, young fella, when your books
are all paid for, I'm gonna buy myself a brand new store suit, and hie
myself off to the Mardi Gras. Ain't too old thataway to git a little fun
out of life, young fella!"
