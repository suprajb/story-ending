Jimmy knew that the Harmons had waited a long time for an excuse. The
Harmons were law-respecting river rats with sharp teeth. Feuding wasn't
lawful, but murder could be made lawful by whittling down a lie until it
looked as sharp as the truth.

The Harmon brothers would do their whittling down with double-barreled
shotguns. It was easy enough to make murder look like a lawful crime if
you could point to a body covered by a blanket and say, "We caught him
stealing our fish! He was a-goin' to kill us--so we got him first."

No one would think of lifting the blanket and asking Uncle Al about it.
A man lying stiff and still under a blanket could no more make himself
heard than a river cat frozen in the ice.

"Git inside, young 'uns. _Here they come!_"

Jimmy's heart skipped a beat. Down the river in the sunlight a
shantyboat was drifting. Jimmy could see the Harmon brothers crouching
on the deck, their faces livid with hate, sunlight glinting on their
arm-cradled shotguns.

The Harmon brothers were not in the least alike. Jed Harmon was tall and
gaunt, his right cheek puckered by a knife scar, his cruel, thin-lipped
mouth snagged by his teeth. Joe Harmon was small and stout, a little
round man with bushy eyebrows and the flabby face of a cottonmouth
snake.

"Go inside, Pigtail," Jimmy said, calmly. "I'm a-going to stay and
fight!"
