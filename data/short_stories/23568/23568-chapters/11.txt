The voice grew suddenly gentle, like a caressing wind.

"You're not old enough yet to go home, Jimmy! Or wise enough. We'll take
you home when the time comes. Now we just want to have a talk with Uncle
Al, to find out how you're getting along."

Jimmy looked down into the river and then up into the sky. Deep down
under the dark, swirling water he could see life taking shape in a
thousand forms. Caddis flies building bright, shining new nests, and
dragonfly nymphs crawling up toward the sunlight, and pollywogs growing
sturdy hindlimbs to conquer the land.

But there were cottonmouths down there too, with death behind their
fangs, and no love for the life that was crawling upward. When Jimmy
looked up into the sky he could see all the blazing stars of space, with
cottonmouths on every planet of every sun.

Uncle Al was like a bright caddis fly building a fine new nest, thatched
with kindness, denying himself bright little Mardi Gras pleasures so
that Jimmy could go to school and grow wiser than Uncle Al.

"That's right, Jimmy. You're growing up--we can see that! Uncle Al says
he told you to bide from the cottonmouths. But you were ready to give
your life for your sister and Uncle Al."

"Shucks, it was nothing!" Jimmy heard himself protesting.

"Uncle Al doesn't think so. And neither do we!"
