He held his breath until they were gone, and darted out from
concealment, walking more rapidly towards his destination.

The mess hall wasn't a hundred yards away from the wire fence that
marked the safety limit. Even from where he was, he could see the
red-lettered sign that warned conqueror and vanquished alike away from
the radiation-contaminated zone.

Bolgar suddenly remembered that he had forgotten his ion gun. The
thought troubled him only slightly. He had more vital things on his
mind.

It was an odd revenge he was after.

The mess hall was a looming black shadow, facing the rows of
sagging-roofed shacks that stretched out for a third of a mile. It was
_their_ quarters; seedier, uglier, far less equipped to withstand the
brutal weather than the barracks; yet somehow, warmer, friendlier,
happier-looking. He hated the sight of them.

He dived into the enveloping darkness behind the mess hall, stealing a
look at the illuminated dial of his watch. He began his vigil.

In a few minutes, _she_ would appear.

Time went slowly.

Then he saw her. She was giving murmured good-byes to the people with
whom she visited night after night. Now it was time to go, half an hour
before the sound of curfew.

He saw her arms adjusting her cape over her head, in the age-old motion
of women.

Now she was walking hurriedly away from the shack, across the square,
her low heels slipping on the loose gravel.

There was a moon, and its light struck her face gently, softly
highlighting the sad loveliness of her features.

When she was some twenty yards away, Bolgar started after her.

He walked lightly, on his toes.

She didn't hear him until it was too late.

His hand went out, and his fingers whipped the cape from her shoulders
to the ground. One arm snaked her waist, the other arched smoothly in
front of her.
