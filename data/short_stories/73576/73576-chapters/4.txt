But she was struggling, her foot kicking out forcefully.

"Just a kiss, baby!"

He leaned over her, laughing, and replaced the hand over her lips with
his own hungry mouth.

The kiss was savage; beyond the force of love or sexual appetite. It
was a blow, a crushing onslaught, a blitz of the emotions.

"You--_animal_!" she cried.

"Listen--"

"Help!" she screamed.

"No--you don't understand--"

"Stop!" he shouted.

He turned around, frantic at the sounds that were gathering behind him.
He saw the figures coming towards them.

When the hands closed around him, he went limp and silent, and allowed
himself to be led away.

The tribunal took action quickly.

The guards, with their rifles firm against their chests, looked at him
with neither hate nor animosity.

The judges were less dispassionate.

"Lieutenant Bolgar?"

He stared over their heads.

"Janice Damon?"

The girl stepped forward, still sobbing.

"Yes--" she said. "He's the one. He's been watching me. I know it. I've
seen him hanging around the quarters."

The woman in the silken uniform looked solemn.

"You were given many privileges, Lieutenant," she said crisply. "But it
would seem that _men_--" she said the word with loathing--"must always
take advantage of their privileges. Do you have anything to say?"

He shook his head.

"It's greed, you know," the woman said confidentially. The other women
of the tribunal nodded in agreement. "Greed's the downfall of _all_
men. How many wars do you have to lose before you realize that?"

He said nothing.

"Send him to the breeding camp," the woman said carelessly. "He'll pay
for his kiss."

She looked at the girl sympathetically.

"Your lipstick's smudged, dearie."


                                THE END
