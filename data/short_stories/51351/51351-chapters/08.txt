"Captain, you got nothing to worry about," Quartermaster Farley said.
He patted a space helmet paternally. "You got yourself a self-contained
environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the
back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed
you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If
transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're
air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent
that hide. You got it made."

"You are right," I said, "only transphasia comes right through these
air-fast joints."

"Something strange about the trance, Captain," Farley said darkly. "Any
spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand."

"I'm talking about something we do understand--_sound_. These suits
perfectly soundproof?"

"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets
together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to
block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have--"

"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature
spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the
sound."

"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to
find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but--"

"I believe you," I said quickly. "Let's leave it at that. I don't know
what he will hear; what's worrying me is _how_ he'll hear it, in what
sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his
only chance."

"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?"

"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I
suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out."

Farley nodded. "Beat like a telephone time signal?"

"That would do it."

"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts."
