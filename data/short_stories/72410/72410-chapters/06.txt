Harry stared at her, mouth full and half open. He grunted and resumed
chewing. He swallowed. "I suppose that's another of your cracks."

"I don't understand, Harry," Flora said. He took another bite, glanced
sideways at her puzzled expression.

"Of course they aren't making it up. How the devil could they make up a
mountain?"

"I'd like to see those places."

"Here we go again," Harry said. "I was hoping I could enjoy a nice meal
and then view awhile, but I guess you're not going to allow that."

"Of course, Harry. I just said--"

"I know what you said. Well, look at them then." He waved his hand at
the screen. "There it is; the whole world. You can sit right here and
view it all--"

"But I want to do more than just view it. I want to live it. I want to
be in those places, and feel leaves under my feet, and have rain fall
on my face--"

Harry frowned incredulously. "You mean you want to be an actress?"

"No, of course not--"

"I don't know what you want. You have a home, two Full-walls, and this
isn't all. I'm working toward something, Flora...."

Flora sighed. "Yes, Harry. I'm very lucky."

"Darn right." Harry nodded emphatically, eyes on the screens. "Dial me
another coflet, will you?"
