The new Full-wall was installed adjacent to the first, with a joint
so beautifully fitted that only the finest line marked the junction.
As soon as she was alone with it, Flora switched it off. Now two
reflections stared back at her from behind what appeared to be two
intersecting planes of clear glass. She waved an arm. The two slave
figures aped her. She walked toward the mirrored corner. They advanced.
She stepped back; they retreated.

She went to the far corner of the room and studied the effect. It
wasn't as nice as before. Instead of a simple room, neatly bounded on
all four sides by solid walls, she seemed now to occupy a stage set off
by windows through which other, similar, stages were visible, endlessly
repeated. The old feeling of intimate companionship with her reflected
self was gone; the two mirror-women were strangers, silently watching
her. Defiantly, she stuck out her tongue. The two reflections grimaced
menacingly. With a small cry, Flora ran to the switch, turned the
screens on.

They were seldom off after that. Sometimes, when the hammering of
hooves became too wearing, or the shouting of comics too strident,
she would blank them out, and sit, back to the mirror walls, sipping
a cup of hot coflet, and waiting--but they were always on when Harry
arrived, sometimes glum, sometimes brisk and satisfied. He would settle
himself in his chair, waiting patiently enough for dinner, watching the
screens.

"They're all right," he would declare, nodding. "Look at that, Flora.
Look at the way that fellow whipped right across there. By golly,
you've got to hand it to the Full-wall people."

"Harry--where do they make the shows? The ones that show the beautiful
scenery, and trees and rolling hills, and mountains?"

Harry was chewing. "Don't know," he said. "On location, I suppose."

"Then there really are places like that? I mean, they aren't just
making it up?"
