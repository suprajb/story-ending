Around her, the walls roared. A saloon fight was in full swing. She
ducked as a chair sailed toward her, whirled to see it smash down a
man behind her. Shots rang out. Men ran this way and that. The noise
was deafening. That man, Flora thought; the vicious one; he had set it
too loud purposely.

The scene shifted. Horses galloped across the room; dust clouds rose,
nearly choking her in the verisimilitude of the illusion. It was as
though she crouched under a small square canopy of ceiling in the
middle of the immense plain.

Now there were cattle, wild-eyed, with tossing horns, bellowing,
thundering in an unbroken sea across the screens, charging at Flora out
of the wall, pouring past her on left and right. She screamed, shut her
eyes, and ran blindly to the wall, groping for the switch.

The uproar subsided. Flora gasped in relief, her head humming. She felt
faint, dizzy; she had to lie down--Everything was going black around
her; the glowing walls swirled, fading. Flora sank to the floor.
