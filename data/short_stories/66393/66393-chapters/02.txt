It was a late July afternoon, and plenty hot. The sun was reflecting
like yellow-green fire off the hills around, and everybody was sitting
in the shade.

Charley Mason and Sam Knudson were sitting on the store porch playing
gin, and Luke Yates was just coming up the steps, when they heard a car
approaching.

Charley and Sam paused in their game and Luke turned his gray head to
look.

"Maybe this time," Charley said.

Luke Yates studied the dust cloud moving toward town above the tops of
the trees.

"Coming pretty fast," he said. "Bet they drive right on through."

"A dollar," said Charley. "You bounce harder when you drive fast."

"It's on," said Luke.

Waiting, Charley Mason leaned back in his chair and half-closed his
eyes, a lean, bald man in shirt-sleeves, the hand holding his cards
relaxed in his lap. They could hear the murmur of the creek carrying
away the runoff from last night's rain, and the air was sweet with the
breath of the fields off down the valley.

"Rich man," said Charley, looking across the yard at his outhouse,
"poor man, beggar man, thief. In there, you're all alike in the eyes of
God, I guess."

Sam Knudson nodded thoughtfully. "In the eyes of _something_, at any
rate."

"All alike," said Luke Yates.

"Can't see your wallet from _there_," Charley said.

"Your brains either," said Luke.

After a moment, Charley said, "Some people's brains, maybe."

They all nodded.

A green convertible driven by a fat woman came around the bend,
trailing dust, and rattled across the bridge.

"New York license plates," Luke said, squinting.

"Yep," said Charley.

"Maybe she'll bite."

"If she stops," Charley said, "maybe she will."
