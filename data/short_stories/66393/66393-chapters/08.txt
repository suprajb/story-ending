Half a non-existent hour passed--non-existent, because it passed in
_timelessness_. The young man sat quietly, seeming to ponder; the
man in black sat as quietly, smoking his sulphur; the three old men
sat like mice, their eyes shuttling back and forth between the two
antagonists.

At last the young man got up and walked slowly to the outhouse. The
cowbell and its paraphernalia vanished. This time with a flash of white
light.

The man in black dropped a new lump of smoking sulphur into his pipe
and tamped it down with his thumb. He walked to the outhouse and
replaced the bell with a still bigger one. He yanked at the chain, and
raucous bellsound filled the yard.

He came back, and they sat around a while longer.

The young man went out. The new bell vanished with a flash like
diamond-blue lightning.

The man in black sauntered out. In an enormous mounting atop the
outhouse appeared a three-foot church bell.

Its chain yanked down.

_Bong-g-g--bong-g-g--bong-g-g...._

The young man hurried across the yard, shoulders stiff. So quickly that
the man in black, eyes mocking, was forced to stand aside at the very
door of the outhouse to permit him to enter.

The church bell and mounting vanished. With a clap of indignant thunder.

The man in black resumed his chair on the porch. The young man came
slowly back across the yard and sat on the steps.

After a few minutes the young man said, "That wasn't very funny."

"I hardly expected you to think so."

"This can go on for an awfully long time you know."

"I have," said the man in black, "an awfully long time. So do you."

"I think that it's rather a silly thing for you to be concerning
yourself with," the young man said. "After all, it failed to incite
these humans to any thoughts which could really be called sinful."

"Then it is an equally silly thing for _you_ to concern yourself with,
isn't it?"

"I do so because it disturbs humans at a time when they may be nearest
to God."

"I concern myself for the same reason."
