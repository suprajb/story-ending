Ulrich pulled another word association test.

"Love."

"It makes the world go round."

"Blackness."

"Sleep."

"Alone."

"Quiet."

It went on for hours. Von Ulrich always seemed to be angrier because
Barton didn't crack up, or because he insisted on turning in a perfect
service record in the basketball.

"Barton, for God's sake, don't you realize how important this watch is?
This valuable information gathered by these recorders. Think what it
would mean if that data fell into the hands of the Asians! What if you
missed an alarm, or fouled up in some way, and one of these recorders
destroyed all the data?"

"Haven't I been alert all the time, sir?"

"Yes! But you've been out here now for three years! Three years. No one
can possibly stand it longer than six months. And the fact that you've
been here for three years only means some absolutely catastrophic
crack-up is being prolonged, built up inside."

"I don't feel a bit different, sir."

"There are subtle ways of cracking up."

"You _want_ me to have some sort of symptom or something?"

"Don't be ridiculous."
