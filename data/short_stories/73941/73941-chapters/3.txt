One day Cock Eye, waddling on his short legs and with his rotund stomach
protruding, was again strolling around the square in the afternoon. It
chanced that he met Hesbern, who greeted him.

“Say, mister,” the stroller asked, “What’s there funny about me getting
an empty bottle?”

Cock Eye bristled angrily.

“Who you talkin’ to?” he demanded.

Hesbern’s gray eyes looked wonderingly into the man’s face, steady,
narrowing and losing their sparkle in an odd, moon colored opacity.

“Ten-twelve fellers told me you said it was funny,” Hesbern answered
quietly. “I want to know why?”

Cock Eye’s face swelled a blotchy white, red and purple.

“What’s it to ye?” Cock Eye cried, his voice rising from a growl into a
shrill hawklike shriek, which attracted attention far and wide.

“I got that empty bottle for a baby with the stomach ache,” Hesbern
declared. “An old woman ast me to, so’s they could put it on the kid,
account of the lady what had it being in bed, an’ her man sickly. I
don’t see nothin’ funny in a baby having the stomach ache.”

“I don’t care a damn if you do or not!” Cock Eye snarled.

“Uh-huh!” Hesbern grunted, going on his way with two store bundles under
his arm.

“Hey, you!” Cock Eye called after him. “I wanta know what’s aching you
’bout me? Anyhow, you mind yer own business ’bout me!”

Hesbern turned to gaze at the short, thick, angry man.

“Course,” Hesbern answered presently, “I mind my own business. I always
do, mister. I’ve been hearin’ some talk, tha’s all.”

“I don’t care what ye hear!” Cock Eye growled into a shriek.

“Tha’s what I thought!” Hesbern said shortly, and the bartender’s lower
jaw dropped.
