Around the Square in Boxelder the boys told about Cock Eye, the empty
bottle and the stroller down at the campground, where there was a lady
had a baby. The stranger again came uptown and shambled to the Emporium,
went to the post office and headed down the creek to the camp, his arms
carrying packages. He was pointed out, and people laughed. He was the
fellow who asked Cock Eye for an empty bottle. That was funny. He wanted
it to put on a baby’s stomach, too.

“Who are you?” The city marshal, Pete Culder, softened his insult to the
stranger by adding, “If it’s any of my business?”

“Why, my name’s Frank Hesbern,” the man answered readily enough. “I’m
kind of looking around for a new country to settle in.”

“Understand you got a baby with the stomach ache?”

“Me? Oh, my, no! ’Tain’t my baby. I never did get to marry. It’s a
lady’s. She’s camped on the flat. The man he’s sickly. The old lady
asked me to get an empty flat bottle to put on the kid’s stomach, tha’s
all.”

“I see--” Culder nodded--“that’s funny!”

“What?” Hesbern’s gray eyes squinted. “The baby was crying, sir. They
wanted to put warm water on its stomach, ’count of the ache.”

The city marshal laughed and strolled on while Hesbern watched him
wonderingly. Thereafter in the days that followed, sometimes one,
sometimes five or six inquirers would speak to the stroller, asking him
about the empty bottle. After listening to the explanation they would
say:

“That’s funny!”

Then they would go on their way, leaving the awkward stranger puzzled
more and more.
