That night instead of just a few of the boys coming into the One Way
Thru Saloon, the place was crowded. About every one had come out. Cock
Eye Baer, with flat face and glowering eyes, served the drinks, very
tart in his few words.

“Hear that stroller insulted you, Cock Eye?” a newcomer inquired.
“What’d he say?”

“Why, he ast me what’s funny about that empty bottle! I told ’im to mind
his own business, bellyaching around. I stood right up to him an’ tol’
’im I didn’t care what he thought! An’, by Gawd, he said he didn’t care
what I thought! I’m gettin’ sick of him standing up to me thataway. I
don’t have ta take anything from him, I don’t!”

“Tha’s right, Cock Eye!” the listeners exclaimed. “Don’tcha let ’im
bluff you a dad blamed inch, no sir!”

“Don’t worry ’bout me!” Cock Eye snorted. “He won’t be the first man
I’ve handled.”

“Tha’s so, Cock Eye!” approved City Marshal Culder who had dropped in
for a warm. “That feller’s got a bad eye. I could see’t when I talked to
’im.

“I’ll look, Marshall. Trust me!” Cock Eye allowed himself to grin a bit.
“All I want’s you to testify to that to the inquest.”

“You bet, old boy!” Culder shook his head. “I got an eye on ’im myself!
You c’n see he’s thinking something, the way he steps off.”
