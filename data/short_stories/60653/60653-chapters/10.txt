That night Regina called me. "Can you give blood?" she asked.

"Yes," I said. "If I stuff myself, I can get the scales up to a hundred
and ten pounds."

"What type?"

"B. Rh positive."

"Thought you told me that once. Gail is in the hospital. They have to
replace every drop of blood in her body. She may die anyhow."

I thought of the little fluff and squeak that was Gail. I eat de crus'
of de toas'.

"What's the matter with her?" I asked fearfully.

"That damn Hiserean child is _poison_. Gail had a little cut inside her
mouth from where she fell off the slide at school."

"I'll be at the hospital in ten minutes," I said, and hung up shakily.
"Dinner is set for seven-thirty," I told Clay and Billy, and rushed out.

The first person I saw at the hospital was not Regina. It was Mrs.
His-tara.

"How did you know?" I asked. Her integument was dull now and there were
patches of scales rubbed off. Her eyes were almost not visible.

"Mrs. Crowley called me," she said. "In any case I would have been
here. There is in Hi-nin also of poison. There remains for him only
the Return Home. We must rejoice for him."

The smile she brought forth was more than I could bear.

"Gail's germs were poison to him?"

"Oh, no. He poisons himself. It is an ancient hormone, from the early
days of our race when we had what your Mrs. Baden so wisely calls
aggression. It is dormant in us since before the accounting of our
history. An adult Hiserean, perhaps, could fight his emotions and cure
himself. Hi-nin has no weapons--so your physicians have explained it to
me, from our scientific books. How can I doubt that they are right?"

How could I doubt it, either? It would be, I thought, rather like a
massive overdose of adrenalin. Psychogenic, of course, but what help
was it to know that? Would there be some organ in Hi-nin a surgeon
could remove? Like the adrenals in humans, perhaps?

Of course not. If they could have, they would have.
