When I got home it was so late that the stars were sliding down the sky
and I just knew Clay wouldn't have thought to turn the parking lights
on. But he had.

Furthermore, he was still up.

"Were you worried?" I asked delightedly.

"No. Regina called a couple of hours ago."

"_Regina?_"

"She said she was concerned about the expression on your face."

Clay handed me a present, all wrapped in gold stickum with an
electronic butterfly bouncing airily around on it.

I peeled the paper off carefully, to save it for Billy, and set the
butterfly on the sticky side.

Inside the box was a gorgeous blue fluffy affair of no apparent utility.

"Oh, _Clay_!" I gasped. "I can't wear anything like _this_!" I slipped
out of my paper clothes and the gown slithered around me.

Hastily, I pulled the pins out of my hair, brushed it back and smeared
on some lipstick.

"I look silly," I said. "I'm all the wrong type." My little crayola
note was still stuck in the mirror. Phooey to me. "You're laughing at
me."

"I'm not. You don't really look respectable at all, Verne."

I ran into the dining area. "Regina told you about the boudoir slip!"

I heard Clay stumble over a chair in the dark.

"Obscenity!" he said. "All right, she did. So what? I think you look
like a call girl."

I ran into the living room and hid behind the sofa. "Do you really,
truly think so?"

"Absolutely!" Another chair clattered and Clay toed the living room
lights. "Ah!" he said. "I've got you cornered. You look like a chorus
girl. You look like an easy pickup. You look like a dirty little--"

"Stop," I cried, "while you're still winning!"
