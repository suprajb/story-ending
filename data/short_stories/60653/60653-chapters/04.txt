Regina pulled off her hand-woven wrap-skirt and I was shocked to see
she wore a real boudoir slip to work.

"Everybody to their own interesting experiences," she said, laughing at
me. This was obviously one of her triple-level remarks.

"De gustibus," I said, to show I know a few arty things myself, "non
disputandum est."

"You have such moments, Verne! Have you ever seen a Hiserean child?"

"I saw one today."

"Well."

"Well?"

"De gustibus, as you said. You know the other children will eat it
alive, don't you? _Your_ child will. Now Gail...."

It's true that Gail never kicks anyone small enough to kick back. It's
also true that Billy bites.

I unclenched my fists and stretched up with a deep breath so as to
relax my stomach and improve my posture.

"Hiserean children," I pointed out, "are going to have to be adjusted
to our society. As I understand it, they're here to stay. Their sun
blew up behind them and personally I think we're lucky they happened to
drift here."

"I don't see why it's so lucky. I wish we'd gotten one of the ships
full of scientific information. Or their top scientists. Or artists,
for that matter. All _we_ got were plain people. If you like to call
them people."

"They're at least educated people with good sense. And we've got their
ship to take apart and learn things from. And their books and, after
all, some music and their gestural art. I should think you artists
would find that real avant garde."

"Just hearing you say it like that is enough to kill Hiserean art."

"Regina, I know you think I'm a prig, but that isn't the point. And if
it matters to you, I'm _not_ a prig."

"Do you wear boudoir slips?" Regina was biting a real smile.

"No, I don't. But I'd like to."

"Then why don't you?"

"Because I put one on once and I thought I looked absolutely
devastating and you know what my husband said?"

"I won't try to guess Clay's bon mot."

"He said, 'What did you put that on for?'"
