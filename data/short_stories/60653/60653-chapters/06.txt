"Hey!" a cop yelled, pulling up as close to us as his rotors would
allow. "What the hell?"

"I beg your pardon," I said frigidly. It is very frigid in November if
you are out in a helicopter dressed only in a boudoir slip.

"Look de bleesemans!" Gail cried.

"He might shoot everybody!" Billy warned.

Meli began to cry loudly. "He might _choot_! _Ma_-ma!"

"Pardon me, madam," the cop said, and beat a hasty retreat.

When we landed on Hi-nin's roof, Mrs. His-tara came up with him.
She looked at me sympathetically. "You are perhaps molting, beloved
friend?" Her large eyes retracted and filled with tears. "Such a
season!"

"No--no, dear. Just--getting a little fresh air."

I put Hi-nin on the front seat with me. He gave me a big-eyed,
toothless smile and sat down in perfect quiet, except for the soft,
almost sea sound of his breathing.

It was during one of those brief and infrequent silences we have that I
noticed something was amiss. No sea sound.

I looked around to find Billy's hands around Hi-nin's throat.

"Billy!" I screamed.

"Aw!" he said, and let go.

Hi-nin began to breathe again in a violent, choked way.

"Billy," I said, wondering if I could keep myself from simply throwing
my son out of the helicopter, "Billy...."

"It is nothing, nice mama," Hi-nin said, still choking.

"Billy." I didn't trust myself to speak any further. I reached around
and spanked him until my hand was sore. "If you _ever_ do that again--"

"_Waa!_" Billy bawled. I'm sure he could be heard quite plainly by the
men building the new astronomical station on the Moon.
