Listen (he said), listen to the great mechanical symphony, the big
black combo. The airplanes are the double bass. Have you noticed how
you can always hear one nowadays? When one walks out of the sky another
walks in.

Presses and pumps round out the bass section. Listen to them rumble
and thump! Tonight they've got an old steam locomotive helping. Maybe
they're giving a benefit show for the old duffer.

Cars and traffic--they're the strings. Mostly cellos and violas. They
purr and wail and whine and keep trying to get out of their section.

Brasses? To me the steel-on-steel of streetcars and El trains always
sounds like trumpets and cornets. Strident, metallic, fiery cold.

Hear that siren way off? It's a clarinet. The ship horns are tubas,
the diesel horn's an oboe. And that lovely dreadful french horn is an
electric saw cutting down the last tree.

But what a percussion section they've got! The big stuff, like
streetcar bells jangling, is easy to catch, but you have to really
listen to get the subtleties--the buzz of a defective neon sign, the
click of a stoplight changing.

Sometimes you do get human voices, I'll admit, but they're not like
they are in Beethoven's _Ninth_ or Holst's _Planets_.

_There's_ the real sound of the universe (the Professor concluded,
shutting the window). That's your heavenly choir. That's the music
of the spheres the old alchemists kept listening for--if they'd just
stayed around a little longer they'd all have been deafened by it. Oh,
to think that Schopenhauer was bothered by the crack of carters' whips!

And now it's time for this mouse to tuck himself in his nest in the
dynamo. Good night, gentlemen!
