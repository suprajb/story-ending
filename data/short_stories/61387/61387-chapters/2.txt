"What a paste," said Shorty, admiringly. "You could have killed him
like that."

"He sure ain't doing much moving," said Pete, coming around the end of
the bar. "I'd better take a look."

"Man, I didn't hit him that hard."

"Well, _man_, he sure asked for it," said Shorty. "And me and Pete will
be right here to tell the cops that the guy was a crook and tried to
rob your money. Right, Pete?"

"George, this guy's got no pulse," Pete said.

"Watcha gonna do, George?" Shorty said.

"Just shut up and wait a minute," Pete said. "I think he's trying to
say something."

The man's eyes pleaded with each of the three. His lips quietly formed
their message:

"Dime."

"Wow, talk about persistence," said Shorty.

George looked at his change on the bar.

He picked up a dime.

"Hey," said Shorty, "what are you doing?"

"Shut up," said Pete. "George's money is George's money. What he does
with it is his business."

"Look," George said, "I didn't mean to hit you so hard. I mean, I hit
you so hard my whole hand hurts. So here, you can have the dime, I
won't miss it."

He pressed the dime into the man's hand.
