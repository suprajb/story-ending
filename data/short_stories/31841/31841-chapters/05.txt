The pie tin was now full almost to the rim. The globby stuff sort of
rolled around, trying to find a flat condition, which it finally did.
The motion was not as startling as the sudden quiet that settled over
the surface after a last ripple.

The stuff looked like it was waiting.

The temptation was worse than a park bench labeled "wet paint," so I
stuck my finger in it. Right in the middle of it.

A ripple flashed out from the center like when you drop a pebble in a
pool, and the ripple hit the brim and converged back to my finger.
When it hit, the surface climbed up my finger about an eighth of an
inch. Another ripple, another eighth of an inch, and about now I felt
something like a gentle sucking sensation. Also, another feeling I can
only tell you was "unclammy."

I jerked away fast and shook my finger hard over the pan, but it
wasn't necessary. None of the stuff had stayed with me. In fact, my
finger was dry--powdery dry!

Then I got the feeling that someone was staring over my shoulder.
There was. It was Lottie, and she had a look of horror on her face
that didn't help my nerves a bit.

"Get rid of it, Charlie!" she cried. "Get rid of it! Please throw it
out!"

"Now, now, honey," I said. "It ain't alive."

"It is!" she insisted.

Lottie chatters quite a bit and pretty well speaks her mind. But she
doesn't go around making assertions. When she does come out
flat-footed with a serious statement, it is always from the bottom of
her 22-carat womanly intuition, and she is practically always right.

"How could it be alive?" I argued. I often argue when I know I'm
wrong. This time I argued because I wanted to wipe that awful look off
my wife's face. "Come on in the living room and relax," I said.
