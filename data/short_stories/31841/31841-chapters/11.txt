There, I've finished writing this all down. But I'm still not sleepy.
I'm not worried about patching things up with Lottie. She's the most
wonderful, understanding wife a guy ever had.

My hand feels real good now. I got it wrapped in lard and gauze, and I
could drive the truck if I wanted to.

I'm not afraid of getting fired or bawled out for not coming to work
on time this morning.

No, the reason I haven't turned a wheel on my beer truck today is
something else.

Friday night, when Lottie wanted to wash the roaster, I saved only a
cup of the jelly for my experiments. The rest she washed down the
drain.

The sewer empties into Lake Michigan.

The brewery where I load up is right on the shore of Lake Michigan.

I'm afraid to drive down there and look.
