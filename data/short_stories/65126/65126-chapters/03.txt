Ned Norcross, who was taking Junior Physics II for the third time,
had his mind on neither the Ziegler Effect nor the tragic results of
last night's basketball game. He was slumped at his desk, dreamily
rehearsing the topography of one Honey LaRue, a strip teaser who
nightly practiced her art at the Club Innuendo. Norcross pried himself
up on one elbow to glance toward the clock above the demonstration
bench, then slumped forward on his desk in a faint. Up on the marble
top of the demonstration bench, pulling off a right silk glove in time
to the lazy ripple of a snare-drum, danced Honey LaRue.

as the figure of the girl undulated before his eyes....]

Mr. Tedder yelped, and immediately regretted it. He'd had two beers
three days before; could that bring on hallucination at this late date?
But Honey had gone, taking the Ziegler coils with her. One terminal of
the telegraph key was still connected to the plate on the spark coil,
the other wire ended in a little knot of fused silver. No, this wasn't
the effect that Doctor Ziegler had reported, not at all!
