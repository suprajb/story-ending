Mr. Tedder continued. "The alloy bar's initial movement will be
frustrated, as it were, by the action of a second solenoid placed
within and at right angles to the first. A third coil, within and at
right angles to each of the outer two, completes the process. The
winding ratios of the three solenoids are 476:9:34." Stetzel and
Guenther scribbled the numbers rapidly; Ned Norcross, in the back row,
stirred in his sleep, and two members of the Class of '95 who shared a
volume of the Rocket Patrol's exploits agreed to turn the page.

"What happens to the bar of iron-cerium at this point is a matter
of conjecture. All observers are agreed only in that it disappears.
Perhaps it leaves the coils so rapidly that it neither injures the
wires nor can it be seen. Perhaps the bar passes through a temporary
fissure in the three-dimensional system we perceive, falling into some
yet-unconceivable other dimension. Doctor Ziegler, who first observed
this effect, inclines to this latter belief." Mr. Tedder placed his
fingers on the telegraph key he'd rigged up to close the circuit
through his apparatus. "Watch closely," he cautioned, tapping down on
the key.
