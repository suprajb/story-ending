As we saw that, Captain Hanson laughed aloud. And vast was the joy of
that laughter. Relief, happiness, sheer triumph. And apology. And he
cried:

"You've done it, son! Forgive me for doubting you. We're safe! I don't
know how, but--come on in, boy, and tell us all about it!"

But there came no answer. Only the echo of our own harsh breathing, the
dry scrape of our own feet shuffling restlessly. And new terror loomed
suddenly in the Old Man's eyes.

"Biggs!" he cried. "Lanse, my boy! Lanse!"

And then--

It was like the faintest, winnowed chaff of sound, breathing from far,
far away. A voice speaking. To us. A voice that said:

"--can't come back ... Skipper.... Sparks will understand. Tell him ...
mass-energy ... relationships. And tell ... Diane ... I love...."

That was all. And my brain reeled beneath the import of those fading
words. Suddenly I _knew_! I didn't need to hear Cap Hanson screaming
wild orders to the sailors on the aft deck below, nor to hear their
answer.

"He's not here, sir. He cast off the auxiliary a moment or so ago."

I _knew_!
