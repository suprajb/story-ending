Carter laid a hand upon her shoulder. "Consider, my dear. All your life
you have needed a mother. Now you will have the equivalent of one." He
turned to Walter Maltby. "And you. You have learned to function only as
a result of a dominating wife's promptings. Our jailer will fill that
role for you."

Lastly he regarded Wilmer Payton. "You, young man will be directed and
guided. You will not have need of the brain power with which you are
not equipped.

"All of you will be content. None will have any decisions to make--all
will be taken care of. Can you think of a more pleasant destiny?"

Walter Maltby said, "You're talking in circles. Talking but not saying

Carter had turned away, smiling. "This is very strange. We were
transported to another plane, but not snatched up willy-nilly. There
was a pattern behind it. Three people admirably suited to their new
fate."

Wilmer Payton seized Fleming Carter by the arm and whirled him around.
"Will you please tell us what you're talking about?"

a sail is in reality a greeting card upon which certain words are

"Well, go on--what are the words."

"In English, they would read--'Happy Birthday, Darling.' You are
someone's birthday present."

Peggy's face was ashen. "You speak of _us_," she whispered. "How well
suited _we_ are for this fate. What about yourself?"

Carter smiled. "I expect this to be the most interesting period of my
life," he said. "You see, the present is for me. I picked it out."
