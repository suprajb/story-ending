For a moment my hopes flamed high. I didn't know what Biggs had up his
sleeve, but I dared dream that he had devised some way of overcoming
the pirate menace. But when I managed to get away, unobserved, a few
minutes later to see what he had thrust in my jacket, my hopes died as
suddenly as they had been born.

The stuff was nothing but pepsin. Plain, ordinary pepsin; a by-product
from the outspread Venusian ranches.

I was half minded to chuck the damn stuff away. I thought maybe worry,
desperation, had made Biggs slip his gravs. Then I thought better of
it. After all, he may have had some reason. And in a spot like this,
any gamble was worth taking....

So, slowly, I started getting the stuff distributed around. I
managed to slip half the package to Doug Enderby, the steward, with
instructions to get it to the black gang. I met Chief Garrity 'tween
decks, and gave him some for his engine room crew. Todd took a piece,
wondering, reluctant, but put it in his mouth when I signalled him to
do so. Me? Sure, I had some, too. After all, it tasted good. And a man
might as well check out with a clean taste in his mouth.

The only man I couldn't slip a piece to at any time was Cap Hanson.
Runt Hake had the old eagle eye on the Skipper. Matter of fact, Hake
had the eagle eye on all of us. He didn't miss a trick, that murderous
little squirt. Just before dinner was served he made my heart miss a
beat when he asked, "What are you chewing on, Sparks? Gum?"

He gave me the fright and the out at the same time. I nodded. "Yeah," I
said. Then, fearful not to ask, "You want a piece?"

He shuddered delicately. "Barbarian custom. I do not want a piece."

Boy, was that a break for our side!
