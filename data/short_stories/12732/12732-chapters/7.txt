     And all with pearl and ruby glowing

       Was the fair palace door,

     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,

       And sparkling evermore,

     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty

       Was but to sing,

     In voices of surpassing beauty,

       The wit and wisdom of their king.
