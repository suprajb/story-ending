     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,

       Assailed the monarch's high estate

     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow

       Shall dawn upon him, desolate!);

     And, round about his home, the glory

       That blushed and bloomed

     Is but a dim-remembered story

        Of the old time entombed.
