in his eyes. He collapsed into his favorite chair and dispatched the
android to the bar.

Raymond frowned. "Just say this: Anyone desiring to take over the

"Is that all?"

"Yes, for now. If that doesn't work, I'll call you back." He gave his
address and televisor number and switched off.

Raymond turned to his android and said, "I've reconsidered. Maybe
