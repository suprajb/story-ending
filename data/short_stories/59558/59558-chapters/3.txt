"Really, sir," the android said, "your method of operating this flying
machine is truly offensive."

Raymond jabbed the throttle and the jetcopter leaped forward. He sat
tensely at the controls, beads of perspiration across his forehead.

The android said, "I would suggest, sir, that you allow me to
demonstrate the proper method of operating these controls."

The jetcopter lurched suddenly in a sharp turning motion, and angled
in rapidly for a reckless ground landing at WHEELER'S WONDERFUL USED
ANDROID LOT.

Mr. Wheeler personally met Raymond and the android as they disembarked.
"Greetings," he said. "Looking for a good used android?"

Raymond shook his head. "Got one I want to sell." He pointed and asked,
"How much?"

Wheeler examined the android rapidly and said, "Looks like a good
clean model. Guess I could give you about five hundred cash."

Raymond exclaimed, "What! That the best you can do?"

Wheeler nodded and smiled. "That's Blue Book on this model. Take it or
leave it. That's my top offer--cash."

Raymond turned away. "Come, my faithful manservant," he said
despondently. "Let us return to our dismal retreat, where I can get
properly and thoroughly liquored up."
