On the courthouse steps Cecil Stump stood, hands in hip pockets,
talking to a reporter from the big-town paper in Mattoon, surrounded
by a crowd of late-comers who had missed the excitement inside. He
described the accuracy of his five shots, the sound they had made
hitting the big blue snake, and the ludicrous spectacle the latter
had presented in its death agony. He winked at a foxy man in overalls
picking his nose at the edge of the crowd.

"Guess it'll be a while 'fore any more damned reptiles move in here
like they owned the place," he concluded.

The courthouse doors banged wide; excited citizens poured forth,
veering aside from Cecil Stump. The crowd around him thinned, broke up
as its members collared those emerging with the hot news. The reporter
picked a target.

"Perhaps you'd care to give me a few details of the action taken by
the ... ah ... Special Committee, sir?"

Senator Custis pursed his lips. "A session of the Town Council was
called," he said. "We've defined what a person is in this town--"

Stump, standing ten feet away, snorted. "Can't touch me with no _ex
post factory_ law."

"--and also what can be classified as vermin," Custis went on.

Stump closed his mouth with a snap.

"Here, that s'posed to be some kind of slam at me, Custis? By God, come
election time...."

Above, the door opened again. A tall man in a leather jacket stepped
out, stood looking down. The crowd pressed back. Senator Custis and
the reporter moved aside. The newcomer came down the steps slowly. He
carried Cecil Stump's nickel-plated .44 in his hand.

Standing alone now, Stump watched him.

"Here," he said. His voice carried a sudden note of strain. "Who're
you?"

The man reached the foot of the steps, raised the revolver and cocked
it with a thumb.

"I'm the new exterminator," he said.
