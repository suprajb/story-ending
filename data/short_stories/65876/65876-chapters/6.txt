"Now," said Thompson, "we will see if they've gone." He opened the door
and peered into the room. He shuddered and entered the apartment; the
doctor followed and closed the door.

"Are they here?" inquired the doctor, glancing about the room.

Thompson nodded and pointed. "Sitting on the beam of the spotlight."

"Ah yes." The doctor gazed uncomfortably at the spotlight and gave a
sigh. He pushed Thompson over to the bed. "Lie down," he said. "Do you
have a medicine cabinet?"

"In the bathroom, Doc." Thompson pointed.

The doctor nodded and went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet.
He took out a bottle of antihistamine tablets and shook three into his
hand. He drew a glass of water and walked back to Thompson's bedside.

"Sit up," he said. "Here, take these."

Thompson downed the pills and took a swallow of water. The doctor
set the glass on the bedside table and went over and turned off the
spotlight.

"Now," muttered the doctor. He turned on the lamp beside the bed and
wrapped a green shirt around the bulb, tying the sleeves together at
the top. He turned the lamp on Thompson's face. "You say the little men
give you ideas for stories. Eh?"

Thompson shut his eyes and nodded. "On the desk. See?"

"Oh!" The doctor exhaled. "You write the stories down?"

"Naturally. They're great."

The doctor walked around to the desk, picked up one of the manuscripts.
He whistled softly. "Just relax," he said, turning to Thompson. "I'm
going to read these over."

"Sure, doc." Thompson stretched out comfortably on the bed.
