Thompson closed the door of the phone booth behind him. "Hello," he
said. "I'd like to make an appointment with Doctor Vossman. Today, if
possible."

"Just a moment," said the secretary. He heard her riffle through some
papers. "What date did you say you wanted an appointment?"

"Today!" Thompson repeated. His breathing into the mouthpiece came out
quite clearly in the receiver against his ear.

"Doctor Vossman can see you today at three. What is the name, please?"

"Thompson. Laurence Thompson."

"Very well, sir. Today at three."

"OK." Thompson hung up and emerged from the phone booth. His ham and
eggs were ready at the counter and he sat down and wolfed them. He
counted his money as he went out and decided to stop in the hardware
store down the street and buy a spotlight.

When he got back to his apartment the sunlight was coming in the
window at a forty-five degree angle and the gnomes were almost sitting
on the floor. Thompson plugged in the spotlight and turned the beam
upward. "There," he told the green men. "That okay?"

and floated over to the spotlight beam, sitting rather comfortably on
the edge of it. "We thought of three excellent short stories while you
were away. Would you like to hear them?"

"Yeah, sure," responded Thompson. Might as well take advantage of the
situation while it lasted.

"Very well," said the nearest green man. "Here's the first one."
