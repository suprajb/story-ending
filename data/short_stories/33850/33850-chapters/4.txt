We played until 3 A. M. I won forty-six dollars. (I usually do win ...
I guess over a period of six months or so I'm about five-hundred bucks
ahead of the game. Which is why I like to play over at Joe's, even
though I _am_ always so damned tired when I leave. Guess I'm not as
young as I was.)

Sometimes I wonder why the odds go my way, right down the line. I
almost _never_ lose. But, hell, it _must_ be an honest game ... and if
they're willing to go on losing to "Lucky" Bixby, I'm perfectly
willing to go on winning.

After all, can you think of any reason that makes any sense for
someone to rig a game week after week to let you _win_?

Dear Fred,

     Well, here's a new story. I've cleared it with Joe ... he
     says it's okay to use his name; you know his sense of humor.
     I've used your name, too, but you can change it if you want
     to, being the shy retiring sort you are.

     Frankly, I'm a little dubious about the yarn. It's the
     result of last Friday's poker-session.... I actually did
     have the _deja vu_ sensation, as you'll recall. On the way
     home I stopped in to pick up a chaser, feeling tired as all
     hell (like I always do--these long grinds are too much for
     me, I guess, just like the guy in the story) and the idea
     came to me to slap the old "we are fodder" angle into the
     thing as it happened and write it up.

     But it's still an old plot. And one angle is left
     unexplained: how is the narrator able to know all about the
     _slizzers_ and write about them after Joe gives him the
     _deja vu_ treatment?

     Well, maybe the readers won't mind. I've gotten away with
     bigger holes than that. Try it on Bob Lowndes ... I still
     owe him on that advance. It's up his alley, hope-a-hope.

Dear Jerry,

     I don't go for "The Slizzers." It just ain't convincing. As
     you say, it's an old idea ... and besides--again as you
     say--how does the narrator know what happened?

     The manuscript looks good in my wastebasket. Forget about
     it.

                                       Sympathies.

     Dear Wet Blanket (and aren't you a little old for that?)

     Respectfully nuts to you. After proper browbeating I think
     I'll try the yarn on Lowndes ... it's no masterpiece, but I
     think it's got a chance; he likes an off trail bit, now and
     then. I made a carbon, natch, so your ditching of the
     original comes to naught.

     Funny thing ... every time I read it over I get the
     doggonedest _deja vu_ feeling. Real dynamic thing ... almost
     lifts my hair. Hope it does the same for the readers, them
     as can read. Maybe Joe didn't quite do the job of making me
     forget what happened that night, ha, ha. Say! ... maybe that
     could explain the _narrator's_ remembering what happened ...
     or maybe--hey! A _real_ idea!

     Remember Joe's kidding us about monsters?--remember, you got
     a little sore because he was holding up the game, you
     money-hungry son? I think I'll rewrite the ending to include
     that! ... which oughta take care of the narrator's
     remembering: Joe can be sort of a dopey _slizzer_, a
     blat-mouth, and his screwy theory (which is _true_ in the
     story, or will be when I write it in--say, isn't this
     involved!) can trigger our hero's memory just a bit, shake
     the block a mite, undiddle the synapses etc ... and then
     I'll have you, platinum-butt, step in to head Joe off, under
     pretense of a poker itch.

     You know, it's wonderful the way there are hot story ideas
     in plain old everyday things! S'long ... gonna revise.

Dear Fred,

     Your telegram came too late, and besides, the hell with it.
     Sent the yarn to Bob yesterday (groceries and rent wait for
     no man, you know) and he bought it, like the sensitive and
     discerning editor he is. What're you and Joe getting your
     tails in an uproar about? It's only a gag, so relax. Joe'll
     change his mind when he sees his name in print.

     Would like to have included another angle, by the way: if
     the narrator's amnesia-job _had_ been botched, wouldn't the
     _slizzers_ decide pretty damn quick that he was a menace to
     them and get rid of him? Think I'll send Bob a line or two
     to stick on the end ... you know, the old incompleted
     sentence deal ... just as if, while the narrator was
     finishing the story, the _slizzers_ came in and
