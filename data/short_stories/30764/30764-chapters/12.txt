They drove on in silence for a while. Then Jeffries cleared his
throat.

"Incidentally," he said. "I should apologize for the slip with the
sandwich, even though it turned out to our advantage. I can't quite
explain it. I was thinking of other matters at the moment, and I
suppose I...."

Cavender, who had been gazing drowsily through the windshield, shook
his head.

"As you say, it turned out very well, Reuben. Aside from putting the
first crack in Mavis Greenfield's defenses, it shook up Dr. Al to the
point where he decided to collect as much as he could tonight, cash
the checks, and clear out. So he set himself up for the pinch. We
probably gained as much as three or four weeks on both counts."

Jeffries nodded. "I realize that. But...."

"Well, you'd have no reason to blame yourself for the slip in any
case," Cavender went on. "The fact is I'd been so confoundedly busy
all afternoon and evening, I forgot to take time out for dinner. When
that sandwich was being described in those mouth-watering terms, I
realized I was really ravenous. At the same time I was fighting off
sleep. Between the two, I went completely off guard for a moment, and
it simply happened!"

He grinned. "As described, by the way, it was a terrific sandwich.
That group had real imagination!" He hesitated, then put out his hand,
palm up, before him. "As a matter of fact, just talking about it again
seems to be putting me in a mood for seconds...."

Something shimmered for an instant in the dim air wrapped in its green
tissue napkin, a second ham sandwich appeared.
