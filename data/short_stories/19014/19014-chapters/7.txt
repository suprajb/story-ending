Skippy's story is not invented to be told here. In its main facts it is
a plain account of a well-remembered drama of the slums, on which the
curtain was rung down in the Tombs yard. There are Skippies without
number growing up in those slums to-day, vaguely wondering why they were
born into a world that does not want them; Scrabble Alleys to be found
for the asking, all over this big city where the tenements abound,
alleys in which generations of boys have lived and died--principally
died, and thus done for themselves the best they could, according to the
crusty philosopher of Skippy's set--with nothing more inspiring than a
dead blank wall within reach of their windows all the days of their
cheerless lives. Theirs is the account to be squared--by justice, not
vengeance. Skippy is but an item on the wrong side of the ledger. The
real reckoning of outraged society is not with him, but with Scrabble
Alley.
