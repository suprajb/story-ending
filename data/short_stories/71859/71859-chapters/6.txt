Three days later, Garvey's ship received clearance and came down at
Boston Spaceport. The landing was not made with Garvey's usual skill.
On the final approach he scored a ten-foot hole in the reinforced
concrete landing pit, but finally came to rest.

Eddie Starbuck hurried out to the ship and banged on the port. "Ralph!
Ralph!"

Slowly the port swung open.

"Ralph! What in hell happened to you?" Starbuck cried.

Garvey looked as though he had been wrestling with a meat grinder and
come out second-best. His face was bruised, and his hair had been badly
scorched. He walked out of the ship with a pronounced limp.

"A power line overloaded," Garvey said. "Had quite a tussle before I
could put everything out."

"Wow!" Starbuck said. "Look, Ralph, I'm sorry to put you through this
now, but--well--"

"What's up?"

"Well, that damned surrogate still hasn't been found. The FBI has
ordered inspection of all ships, private and commercial. I'm sorry to
ask it now, after all you've been through--"

"Go right ahead," Garvey said.

The inspection was brief but thorough. Starbuck came out and checked
his list.

"Thanks, Ralph. Sorry to bother you. That power line sure kicked up a
mess, huh?"

"It did," Garvey said. "But I was able to jettison the furniture before
it smoked me out. Now you'll have to excuse me, Eddie. I've got some
unfinished business."

He started to walk away, Starbuck followed him.

"Look, boy, you'd better see a doctor. You aren't looking so good."

"I'm fine," Garvey said, his face set in an expression of implacable
resolve.

Starbuck scratched his head and walked slowly to the control tower.
