Garvey caught a heli outside the spaceport. His head was beginning to
ache again, and his legs were shaky.

The surrogate's strength and tenacity had been unbelievable. If she
had been operating at her full capacity, he would never have survived.
But that last shot at point-blank range had done it. No organism was
constructed to take punishment like that. Not for very long.

He reached his destination in the center of Boston and paid off the
heli. He was still very weak, but resolutely he marched across the
street and entered a plain gray-stone building. His legs wobbled under
him, and he thought again how fortunate he was to have gotten the
surrogate.

Of course, the surrogate, with her amazing vitality, had also gotten
him.

It had been brief--

But unforgettable.

He had been damned lucky to live through it. But it was his own fault
for using substitutes.

A clerk hurried up to him. "Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Can I help?"

"You can. I want passage to Algol, on the first ship leaving."

"Yes, sir. Round trip, sir?"

Garvey thought of the tall, glorious, black-haired, golden-skinned
women he would find on Algol. Not substitutes this time, the real
thing, with the all-important sense of judgment.

"One way," said Ralph Garvey, with a little smile of anticipation.
