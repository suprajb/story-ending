"THE THIRD ILLUSION," said a soft voice.

And he was holding a billowing net and a strange three-pronged weapon.
The sound of a roaring multitude reached his ears. He blinked,
orientating himself to the new illusion, and saw that he was in an
immense stadium. Curiously-garbed people were staring down at him.

_My God_, he thought. _The Coliseum!_

And even as the thought of recognition burst upon him, he saw

The swordsman nodded. He lifted the sword, held it over Hendriks' head,
and looked up at the grand dais. Hendriks looked up as well.

The thumbs were down. Emphatically so.

The sword began to descend--
