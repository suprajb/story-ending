"THE FOURTH ILLUSION," said the voice.

He was racing madly down the Indianapolis Speedway, bobbing along at
nearly 150 miles an hour in a flimsy-looking little racing auto. Blurs
whizzed by on all sides.

Ahead of him he saw a car suddenly swerve into the embankment and burst
into a mass of flames. With desperate urgency he yanked on the wheel,
tried to avoid the pileup--

And failed. He felt his car going end over end into the air, and shut
his eyes, waiting for the explosion that would follow.

"THE FIFTH ILLUSION," the voice said.

He was in a prehistoric jungle; strange stumpy trees were all around,
lush vegetation. A slow-moving beast of immense size was thundering
away from him, its tiny head close to the ground snapping up vegetation
without cease. Overhead a leather-winged flying reptile moved through
the air in jerky swoops.

There was sudden thunder behind him. He turned.

Through a haze of giant mosquitoes he saw a mountain of a beast
advancing toward him, tiny forepaws clutching the air, vast head
opening to reveal foot-long teeth.

He started to run, but even as he did so he knew it was fruitless.
In the steamy jungle sweat poured down him like summer rain. The hot
breath of the tyrannosaur was only feet behind him.

Hendriks turned, looked up. The mighty jaws were opening; the
knife-like teeth beckoned.

"No!" he screamed "No!"

Suddenly all went blank.
