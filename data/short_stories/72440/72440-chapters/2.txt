Beth turned a hopeful gaze to Pete. "_Should_ we, darling? It's not
like a shelter, like you were worried about. We don't have to come out
and look for food in the rubble. We can live indefinitely on Moonbase.
Please, darling! Please?"

"I've got to think," said Pete, blinking. "It never occurred to me I'd
have a third choice. I was resigned to sitting and waiting for the
blast. Now--I'm all mixed up."

"It's _life_ Martin's offering us!" pleaded Beth. "You can't turn down
an offer of life, real survival!"

"But--But _is_ it?!" asked Pete, uncertainly. "We can't leave Moonbase
any more than we could leave Corey's shelter. What difference if we're
buried alive to avoid radiation or freezing vacuum?"

"Pete, _please_!" said Beth, almost screaming.

"Damn it, Pete, make up your mind!" snapped Martin. "I can't wait
another minute. My wife's out in the car; she's trusting me to take her
to safety!"

"I--I won't go! Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't want to leave. If I
had time to think--"

"All _right_!" said Martin, starting for the door, angrily. "Try to do
a favor, risk your own life, and--" Then he relented and rushed back to
his neighbor. "Good luck, Pete," he said, gripping the older man's hand
tightly. "Goodbye, Beth."

"No! No, wait!" said Beth Crolin, not daring to look at her husband's
face as she rushed after the young man. "_I'll_ come with you!"
Pete just stood like carven stone, watching, as Beth hurried down
the front path into the night toward the waiting car. Martin, sick
with embarrassment, turned a wryly apologetic grin Pete's way before
following after her.

When the sound of the engine faded in the distance, Pete finally
managed to move, and closed the door on the cold night outside. He went
to the kitchen, stared hard at the bottle of wine in its corner of the
pantry shelf, then yanked it down and smashed it to glittering bits in
the sink.
