"It's over," said Corey to his wife. Lucille nodded dully. "Don't you
understand, honey? The bombing's stopped, and we're still alive. Enough
food for months. The radiation-count will be down by then, and--"

"And what?" asked Lucille, staring from her husband's face to the two
children sleeping on the military cot before the crowded bookshelf.
"When it's down, what happens next?"

"Why--We go out. We rebuild."

"Rebuild? Rebuild what? How?" said Lucille. "Can you build a radio? If
you could, who would we talk to, listen to?"

"I mean, rebuild houses, start farming, raise animals...."

"Will the land grow food any more? Are there animals left out there,
or did they forget to burrow underground when the fires began?" said
Lucille.

"Be reasonable, honey!" said Corey.

"That's what I'm being, for the first time in years," she said. "I wish
we'd stayed with Pete and Beth."

"They've turned to ashes by now," said Corey.

Lucille shrugged. "Maybe they're better off." The baby began to cry,
and kick its round pink legs.

"I think the baby needs a change, or something," said Corey, looking
down at his infant son.

"Read him _Coningsby_," said Lucille. Then she started laughing again,
until Corey was forced to slap her face crimson to quiet her.
