Walton was warm when he awakened. At first he could not understand. He
must have slept long, because the sun was shining somewhere behind the
southerly arc of that leaden sky. There was protest on his lips as he
crawled from beneath the walrus-hide. “Now, I say--” he began; then he
understood. The skin of seal-oil, the pitiful furry pile of parka and
other garments, the stiff mukluks, told it all. Except for the single
sip, the skin of oil had been untouched. The native had starved with
him, then left him his all. Walton made his way to the water’s edge,
taking the trail trod by naked feet not many hours ago. He looked
thoughtfully at the water as if seeking means to convey that which was
in his heart.

“‘Greater love hath no man--’” he began, then dropped to his knees. The
water lapped desolately at the floe as if to claim it and that which it
held for all time; the breath of the Arctic nipped spitefully at the
exposed parts of his face. “O God,” he cried, “make me worthy of the
sacrifice of a--Man!”
