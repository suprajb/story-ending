For a moment, sheer shock immobilized Peter. He had expected cringing
capitulation; he had met defiance, instead. It is a different matter
to dream of slaughtering hundreds of charging enemies than to pull the
trigger on one, small antagonist armed with only a gunnysack. So Peter
did nothing.

But the _saboteur_ did an amazing thing. He pencilled a checkmark
in his little notebook. Then, quietly crooning a tune that sounded
astonishingly like a lullaby, he shouldered his bag and started from
the room. Peter roused. His piping voice rang clarion-clear in the
echoing chamber.

"Oh, no you don't! Stand still, you! Drop that bag and lift your hands
or I'll--I'll--"

And he got what he wanted. The visitor _did_ drop the bag. But his
clutch was not nerveless from fright so much as from surprise! A look
of blank incredulity widened his eyes, and his jaw dropped slack as he
gasped:

"You--you're still awake!"

"You bet your boots I'm awake!" declared Peter boldly. "You didn't
think you'd get _me_ with that stuff, you--"

"And you--" gulped the little man--"you _see_ me!"

"See you? Of course I see you! If you take another step, you dirty old
Nazi, you--"

"Nazi!" exclaimed the stranger indignantly. "I'm no Nazi!"

"Oh, no? What's your name?"

"My name," said the chubby one, "is Ole Luk Oie. In some circles I am
known as Noctus or Suom, but--"

"Never mind the aliases," said Peter. "Ole Luk Oie, eh? A Norwegian.
One of Quisling's men?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," blazed his prisoner. "I don't
know anything about quisling. I've never quissled in my life. But I do
know _one_ thing: when I see the Assignment Clerk at the O.D.D. again,
I'm going to raise blue fumes about this! I was _never_ so mortified!
Imagine _me_ held at a pistol's point by a mortal who defies my Sands--"

"That'll do!" rapped Peter sternly. "I'll talk; you answer. What's this
O.D.D. you mentioned?"

"Why, the Office of Dream Distribution," snapped the stranger, "of
course! The outfit I work for. Now, see here, mortal--point that thing
the other way before it goes off by accident and creates a scandal. It
can't kill me, of course, but hanged if I want to go through eternity
with lead bullets in my gizzard. Woden knows my digestion is awful
enough now, what with staying up all night and those brazen Walk√ºre
keeping me awake all day with their noisy war-chants--"

But he need not have elaborated on his request. For Peter, his
hand wobbling like an aspen leaf in a tornado, had already thrust
the .44 back into its holster, and was staring at his captive with
horror-stricken eyes. Peter passed a dry tongue over drier lips. And:

"W-who are you?" he croaked.

"I've already told you once," said the little fellow testily. "I'm Ole
Luk Oie. The Bringer of Sleep. The Sandman!"
