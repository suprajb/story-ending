That was the thought that Roy Mallory usually carried in his mind as he
went about his business of Production and Coordination. And sometimes
it effected his coordination, but never his production. As a TV
producer, he was tops. And now, the youngest man in the sharpest of all
businesses, he was assigned to handle the biggest "spectacular" of them
all. To give you an idea of how highly regarded he was, having given
him the assignment, Herman Fendler also gave him his secretary--but
strictly on loan.

Roy's face was flushed as he walked back to his office, Edith beside
him, Fendler's words still ringing in his ears.

"The Big Show!" he breathed. "Wow!"

"Not too big for you," said Edith.

"Not with you to handle the details," he returned, gallantly.

"That will be wise," she said.

"Huh?" he said.

"To let me do all the handling."

He flushed a different kind of flush now. "What makes you think...."

"The look on your face when Mr. Fendler said you could have me. I've
seen that look hundreds of times, and it always means the same thing."

"But...." he protested.

"We understand each other perfectly, don't we?" she asked sweetly.

"Yes. We have our desks in separate offices."

"No we don't. I intend to sit with my desk directly opposite you so I
can keep my eye on you at all times. Mr. Fendler gave me the job of
seeing that you do your job, and I'm going to do it."

"Sadist," he snapped.

"Of course," she agreed. "But can I help it?"

He looked at her, and suddenly he grinned. "No, you can't. But with
you sitting across from me, that realization won't lessen my sufferings
any."

"It won't be so bad," she said. "You can look."

"You _are_ a sadist!" he exclaimed.
