Nobody knows how they did it, but NBC and CBS got a dual contract with
the Martians for the commercials! Yes, it's true. The Martians agreed
to monitor their commercials, and then rebroadcast them as part of the
Big Show that was to introduce Earthmen to Martians.

The sponsors weren't difficult to sell! They fell all over themselves
to get spots on the program.

Actually, the whole thing was the most serious development in world
history. Picture it for yourself. Out of a clear sky, one day (and
night, because it involved the whole Earth in the same instant) a voice
came from outer space, from Mars, and introduced us to a form of life
our scientists had always claimed was a member of the lichen family,
but which actually was a lot more human than you are. What we had
thought was the lowest form of mossback, was actually the highest human
civilization in the solar system. Wedgewood china, suspension bridges,
and hot dogs were old stuff thirty thousand years ago with the
Martians. They were really advanced. And when we understood it (most of
us, that is) we felt mighty flattered to think that they were going to
try to rub some of it off on us.
