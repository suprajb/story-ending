A burst of applause followed, and Fendler beamed. "You think of
everything, my boy," he approved. "Makes the show seem more live."

Roy looked at Edith and snorted, almost inaudibly. She looked back. "No
matter what you think," she whispered, "I can tell you he expected it,
and your name would be mud if you hadn't included it. Don't let it go
to your head."

"That's right," whispered Roy sarcastically. "Look out for me like a
mother."

Another voice came now, and with it the face of the first Martian ever
seen on Earth.

Edith gasped for breath. "He's _beautiful_!"

The wind sagged out of Roy's sails, "Oh, no!" he groaned. "The last
thing I expected--competition!"

"Not at all," said Edith. "You never had a chance!"

"He'll never lay a hand on you," said Roy maliciously. "Unless he can
do it over TV."

"If he could, I think I'd let him," returned Edith sweetly.

"Your cruelty is savage beyond comprehension," growled Roy. "Why don't
you jump off the roof...." His voice trailed away as he listened to the
Martian.

"Fellow men and women of Earth," came the voice, exquisitely clear and
cultured. "We are happy to present ourselves to you. In order that you
may know us completely, we will begin with what we on Mars consider
the most important facet of our lives--the family. The next thing you
will see is a Martian wedding, which is really the beginning of living
on Mars. Until the day a Martian man and woman join themselves as a
family, to begin the wonderful task of continuing the race, it cannot
be said that they have really been alive, but only going through the
first faint stirrings of life as it really is. Look now upon a Martian
wedding day."
