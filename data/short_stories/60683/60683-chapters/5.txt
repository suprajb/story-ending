"Ryshid!" Baker yelled on entering his quarters. "Get my smoking
jacket! Isn't dinner prepared yet?"

The turbaned, green-skinned native did what might have been called a
_salaam_ if he had been a Moslem instead of a Hindu. "Everything is in
readiness, _Sahib_."

Baker was sorry he had spoken so shortly, but somehow he always did.
Ryshid understood. Baker was under a terrible strain, not knowing when
the ETI might descend on him. There was also the matter of Malissa, his
wife, whom he missed very much. But as a Hinduphile, a true convert,
Ryshid was of a gentle and forgiving nature.

As Baker settled back in his easy chair, someone started smashing in
the back door.

By the time the police of Lintz reached the living room, Baker was gone.

"Alas," the sergeant-major intoned, "if only the sinner had repented
his purchase of the forbidden book before instead of after he finished
reading it."
