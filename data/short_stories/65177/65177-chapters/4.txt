Harrell took two or three deep breaths, clearing his head. He grinned.
"I've got them," he said. "Information on troop movements, plan of

come you didn't get me out at the half-hour mark?"

"Eh?"

"I told you to pull me out after half an hour had gone by. Why didn't
you? I was in there half a day, at least--and I might have stayed there
forever."

The psychman was looking at him strangely. "Half a day, you say? No,
Lieutenant Harrell. The total time elapsed from the moment you donned
the helmet to the instant the alien screamed--why, it was less than 10
seconds!"
