By the end of May George was still chopping a small clearing in the
Montana woods. George and Charlie's old campsite. It was harder work
than he'd expected. But it was a good site and the tent would be
replaced by a heavy log cabin before winter set in. Sometimes they'd
climb one of the peaks on the Flathead Range and sit gazing at Hungry
Horse Reservoir in the distance.

The trees were stubborn here, blunting the ax. But they'd make it all
right. George sat down to rest.

Rosy waved to him from the potato patch. A strand of smoke rose
peacefully from the stone oven. He waved back and grinned.

Timmy worked his way up bravely to where George sat. He'd gotten used
to his bark shoes and had quite forgotten that he had ever worn any
other kind.

"Can I help you, Daddy?"

Education too, George thought. The _real_ kind. "No, thanks, son," he
said. "You'd better help your mother plant the potatoes."

That evening at supper, as they sat enjoying sundown and the quiet of
woods and mountains, they heard a motor far away. The wind took it away
and then it sounded much nearer, grinding in low gear. George stood up
as a jeep came round the mountain. In it sat a man and a woman.

The jeep came into the clearing, swaying over stones and roots.

"Charlie!"

"Hi," Charlie said. He helped Beth down.

George yanked Timmy to his feet. "Stand up, son. This is the President
of the United States."

"I got a present for you, George," Charlie said.

"Not another pressure cooker!" Rosy said.

"A peace pipe," Charlie said.

Timmy's big round eyes took him in. "Are _you_ the President?" he asked
in a small, awed voice.

"Not any more," Charlie said.

George stared at him. "You didn't give up the White House?"

"What else could I do?" Charlie said. "I gave it back to the Indians."
