This time she answered and all was fine. She'd spent the morning in the
supermart filling out contest entry blanks and buying a big roast for
the pressure cooker.

"Oh, George, it's a wonderful pressure cooker. It looks like a space
ship, with bolts and portholes and all."

"I don't want you to--"

"And it's got a remote control panel or something, with all kinds of
buttons and blinkers. Timmy just loves it!"

"Is Timmy anywhere near it?"

"He's _in_ it. It's a big one."

Arlene came by his desk. "Where's Charlie?" she asked. "I got a
telegram for him."

George waved her away and brought the receiver close to his mouth.

"Rosy, listen," George hissed. "Put that damn thing away till I get
home. We're going to the Emperor Room with Beth and Charlie."

There was a short silence. "You said you wanted a home-cooked meal,"
Rosy said. "To remind you how married you are."

George looked up at Maude Doody standing at his desk. "That sounds
like a personal call," Meddlin' Maude said.

"It's my wife."

"You've been on that phone three minutes," Meddlin' Maude said,
glancing at her watch. "You know company policy on personal calls,
George."

"I'm a homemaker," Rosy was saying. "I _want_ to make dinner for you
and Timmy."

"Oh, go to hell!" George said.

Meddlin' Maude clutched at her heart.

Rosy gasped.

Five minutes later:

"Of course I love you, baby doll," George said weakly. In a semi-circle
around him stood Meddlin' Maude, Mr. Zungenspiel, Mr. Perkins, Arlene,
and an assortment of lesser office authorities. "Just don't touch that
pressure cooker till I get home, dammit. It's dangerous."

"I can only do my best, George," Rosy said with hard finality. "If
that's not good enough for you, darling"--she choked on a sob--"well,
I'm _sorry_."

The phone clicked and the wire went dead.
