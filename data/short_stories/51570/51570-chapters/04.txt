A dozen faces bent over him. "George," Meddlin' Maude said, raising her
sharp pencil.

"Just a minute, Miss Doody," said Mr. Zungenspiel. "Young man, would
you step into my office when you have a _free_ moment?"

"If you see Charlie before they fire you," Arlene said, "tell him I
left a telegram on his desk."

"George," Miss Doody shrilled, her sharp pencil raised, "did you or did
you not tell _me_ to go to hell?"

Charlie crashed through the crowd, waving a telegram. "Look at this,
George!"

George read the telegram:

George dropped the telegram.

"What are you waiting for, man?" Charlie said. "Call Rosy, will ya?"

"She won't answer," George said. "She thinks I don't love her."

"Come on! We better get home before she starts making dinner."

They ran down to the Park-O-Port.

"Ahm sorry, Mistuh Charlie," the snappy attendant said. "Caint git yuh
cah now. It's on de top floh behind seven lines of cahs an _dey_ aint
comin out till five like every weekday sept Satterdays, Sunneys an
holidays."

"Give him a tip and let's get a taxi," George said. He ran into the
street just in time to flag a cab.

George tossed the cabbie ten dollars. "Step on it. It may be a matter
of life and death."

"I could have called Beth," Charlie said.

"We'll get there almost as fast."

They zoomed through the underpass and turned onto the freeway. A cycle
cop emerged from behind a Schlitz billboard and took after them, his
siren wailing.

"Never mind the cop," George said.

The cabbie hunched forward and gripped the wheel. "Mister," he said,
"I've been waiting for a chance like this."
