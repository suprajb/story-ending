The cop gained on them and as he came abreast George grew confused. He
saw the cop's big sun glasses shining like the eyes of a wasp and his
hat snapping in the wind. George had never broken the law in his life.
He had a deep respect for the police, preservers of law and order.

The cop motioned the cabbie to pull over. The cab zoomed over a crest
on the freeway and ripped down the slope with marked increase in speed.

George rolled down the window and flapped his arms. "My wife!" he
yelled.

The cop cut the siren. His hand went down to his holster.

"My wife!" George yelled. "Pressure cooker."

The cop grinned and nodded to say he understood, and roaring ahead
waved them to follow. The siren started up again.

They lost him when they turned off the freeway and raced past the
supermarket to their street. Sunnydale looked peaceful in the
afternoon. George's house came in view. He heaved a sigh of relief as
the cabbie pulled to a stop.

"Rosy!" he yelled, dashing up the walk.

He flung open the door and stopped. The house was silent except for
Rosy's voice in the kitchen. She was counting backwards:

"Five ... four ... three...."

"Rosy!"

"One ... zero."

A steaming hiss sounded in the kitchen. In a moment it rose to a
howling pitch. There was a tremendous crash and a tremor shook the
plaster from the walls.

In the settling dust Timmy crawled out of the kitchen with a pot on his
head.

In the kitchen Rosy sat on the floor, clutching the instruction booklet.

"Now see what you did, George!"

"What _I_ did?"

"Barging in like that," Rosy said, tears of frustration streaking her
dusty cheeks. "I must have pressed the wrong button."

Beside her on the floor lay the Touch Command Control Panel. Its
colored lights blinked on and off like a pinball machine.

Charlie came into the kitchen with Timmy in his arms.

"Oh my gosh!" Rosy cried, looking up at the ceiling. A hole was ripped
out in the roof and through it they could see God's blue sky.
