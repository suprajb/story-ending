_One more touch before the die is cast_, thought the marshal, as two
young officers opened the balcony doors to admit the blare of
trumpets.

Cheers rolled successively across the square, rising like distant
waves from somewhere beneath the gigantic banner that draped the
capitol opposite with fiery letters spelling out "PEACE CONFERENCE."

With a dramatic gesture, Hennings held up the sheaf of reports they
had just reviewed. Smiles disappeared in response to his own serious
mien.

"So much for the hostilities!" he snapped. He tossed the reports to
the officer who would remain in charge. "_Now for the actual war!_"

Pivoting on his heel, he led them smartly out to the ornate balcony
stairway that curved down into the sea of cheering Polluxians.

THE END
