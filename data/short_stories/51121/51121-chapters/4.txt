Mr. Marsh was thoughtful and silent.

Carol asked, "Weren't there any records in the lifeboat?"

"Nobody thought of that, at least not in the beginning. At first, when
I regained consciousness, my mind was almost a complete blank. Then I
began to remember things, but not enough. I couldn't recall where the
colony had been, and after I had recovered enough to be able to get
around, I began looking for my wife and children. I haven't come across
a trace of them, although I've been on many worlds."

The food had long been ready and waiting. Until now, no one had thought
of getting it. He stared as if through the wall and Carol, after she
had set the dishes before him, had to remind him of their presence.
When he did eat, it was automatically, without enjoyment.

Afterward, her father surprised Carol by saying, "Why not stay with us
overnight, Mr. Callendar? We have an extra room, and tomorrow I may be
able to give you a little helpful information."

The man's eyes came alive. "You're serious? You think that from what I
told you, you'll be able to guess where I came from?"

"I used the word 'might.' Don't get your hopes up too much."

His face fell again. "Thanks for warning me," he said in a flat tone.

When, later on, he had gone to his room, Carol said, "Dad, do you
really think you can help him?"

"That depends on your idea of help. Why are you so interested in him?
Perhaps you're falling in love with him, Carol?"

"I think so."

"Under the circumstances, that's completely idiotic. Would there be any
sense in asking _why_ you fell in love with him?"

"Well, he looked so _lost_! I guess it's maternal--"

"As genuine a case of the grand passion as I've ever encountered," he
said drily. "Almost as genuine as your previous experience."

Carol flushed. "He isn't like John."
