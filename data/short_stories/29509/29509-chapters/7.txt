Where was he? What did it mean? Anders' mind tried to add it up.

Impossible. _That_ couldn't be true.

Again the score was tabulated, but Anders' mind couldn't accept the
total. In desperation, the overloaded mind erased the figures,
eradicated the knowledge, erased itself.

"Where am I?"

In nothingness. Alone.

Trapped.

"Who am I?"

A voice.

The voice of Anders searched the nothingness, shouted, "Is there anyone
here?"

No answer.

But there was someone. All directions were the same, yet moving along
one he could make contact ... with someone. The voice of Anders reached
back to someone who could save him, perhaps.

"Save me," the voice said to Anders, lying fully dressed on his bed,
except for his shoes and black bow tie.
