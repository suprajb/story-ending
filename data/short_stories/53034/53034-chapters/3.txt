Two days later, a second God was detected. It silently circled Phobos
from the Universal Eye.

It did not land. It silently circled Phobos, and then returned to the
Eye.

Within the day, it was back, in the company of eleven other Gods. They
landed. Joyfully, mortals went forth to meet them.

It was quite a battle while it lasted.

Joy quickly ended, as the Gods died one by one, each of them showing
the holes eaten in their sides by the insatiable _plllnks_.

Likewise, eventually, died all the _plllnks_, which presumably had
killed the Gods. They fought with strange white flares and crackling
blue flashes, which only tickled the hides of the faithful. Then they
were shredded.

Religious beliefs on Phobos underwent certain basic changes. Such as:
the Gods, or at least their Messengers, were known not to be immortal.

Nor were the special variety of _plllnk_ which afflicted them....

On Earth, twenty years afterward, word is anxiously awaited of the 4th
Mars Expedition.
