The God was dead.

Killed by the giant _plllnk_--a scourge from which, evidently, even
the Gods were not spared. The huge _plllnk_, even now creeping
around--wrinkle-skinned and detestable, its coloration the same as the
God's; the most loathsome sight imaginable ... a god-_plllnk_!

Grg and Yrl moved into view, from the shadows of the crater wall.
Their thinking trunks tingled with misery, sorrow, bitter anger and
disappointment.

The _plllnk_ stopped, having sensed them. Then it darted for the hole
it had eaten in the God.

Yrl moved to intercept it. The _plllnk_ changed course and headed
swiftly up a sand dune. With a great bound, impelled by outrage, Yrl
was upon it.

While Grg touched tentacles with the dead God, in reverent mourning,
in terrible sorrow, in loss, in supplication, Yrl shredded the
god-_plllnk_.
