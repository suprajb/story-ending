It is a curious coincidence that the youngest two literatures of the
world, American and Russian, should each have contributed so materially
to the development of the short-story. During the eighteenth century
American literature was compassing a slow growth; but in Russia
literature was virtually sleeping. Later, both come to effective
expression at about the same time. While Irving, Hawthorne, Poe,
Harte, Stockton, James, and O. Henry were telling wonderful stories in
our land, Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoi, Dostoevski, Korolenko,
Garshin, Chekhov, Andreev, and Gorki were doing the like in Russia.
The balance dips toward America for literary art, but for sheer
strength it unmistakably drops on the side of the Slav. Thus throughout
the nineteenth century and till now the short-story has been a form to
be reckoned with in any adequate estimate of Russian writers, just as
in the two other literatures whose recent development follows similar
lines--American and French.

When the modern short-story was born in its technical perfection
in America, France, and Russia almost simultaneously, the French
Revolution had worn out most of its evil effects and the New Spirit was
beneficently at work in every enlightened land. The superior value of
human beings, the benumbing effects of slavery, the priceless qualities
of real liberty, and the absolute necessity for an enlightenment which
should be something more than education, became ideals worth fighting
and dying for.

It is important to note here that great short-stories from that day to
this have developed themes vital to the people for whom and by whom
they were written.
