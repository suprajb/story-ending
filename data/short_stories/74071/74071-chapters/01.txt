                        THE RUSSIAN SHORT-STORY


In introducing the volumes of this series which deal with the work
of French fictionists I commented upon the real distinction existing
between the French short-story and the short-story in French, asserting
that the former is a precise term because the greater number of worthy
short-stories in French really exhibit the typical French spirit and
are therefore French.

The Russian short-story is even more pronouncedly national in
theme, in tone, and in treatment than is its French contemporary;
indeed, Muscovite literature is the most markedly national of any
in Europe. This would not be so significant a statement were modern
Russian literature--by which I mean all such literature which really
counts--more than a century old; but this ancient, remote, and
self-sufficient people really lived for so long a time apart from the
great highways of Continental thought that they were not nationally
conscious of those titanic upheaving and levelling passions whose
fitful and at times appalling force shook France, England, and even
Poland to the very heart and forced their thinkers to express the
spirit of the revolutionary era in undying prose.

Instead, Russian writers of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth
centuries occupied their pens with imitations of foreign--chiefly
French--literature, or wrote minute local descriptions which were
important not so much for what they were as for what they pointed to--a
new national consciousness.
