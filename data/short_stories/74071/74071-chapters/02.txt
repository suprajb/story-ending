But in order to get an understanding of modern Russian literature we
turn backward in our swift survey. When Peter the Great, that much
magnified and more maligned potentate, ascended the throne, he found
Russia the home of bigotry, prejudice, and barbarism. But before his
unceremonious blows the doors swung reluctantly open, and from the
west a steady concourse of European ideas, often accompanied in person
by their thinkers, moved through the gates and penetrated every upper
circle. Naturally, literature was the first of the arts to throb
with this infusion of outside blood, and naturally, also, its first
expressions were in that form of flattery which is alleged to be most
sincere.

But when national consciousness is awakened, national pride soon
begins to utter lusty sounds, and its theme is certain to be as
national as its form of expression. So, with the dawn of the nineteenth
century--Lomonosoff, Kantemier, Sumarakov, the Empress Catherine,
Von Viezin, Derzhavin, Karamsin, and Zhukovski having in the previous
century done fine service in poetry, history, and the drama--there
opened a new era: the period of artistic Russian fiction. The barbaric
richness and fearless crudity of the old poetry were exchanged for
sophisticated prose.

Kriloff deserves special mention here, even though to Gogol and Pushkin
must go the trail-blazersâ€™ honor. His fables and tales were distinctly
in advance of previous similar work, but the real fictive creators were
yet to come. Kriloff was at once the last of the old and the first of
the new prose-writers.
