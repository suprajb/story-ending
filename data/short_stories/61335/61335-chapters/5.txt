I had succeeded in setting up a makeshift easel in my room at the Dorm,
and was working on a painting, wearing some of Dad's old clothes, when
the proctors broke in.

One of them pointed a small indicator at me, glanced at it and nodded.

"She's the one. Instability and escapism. And look at the kind of
clothes she wears."

"What are you doing?" I whispered. This was how they'd taken my parents!

"You're under detention as a criminal against society. Miss," one of
the proctors said. "We're all sorry."

Another one stepped forward and held out a hand to me as one might a
child. "Come along now."

"_No!_" I backed away from them, and when they trapped me in the corner
I kicked and screamed at them. "Leave me alone, leave me alone! You're
killers!" One of them grabbed me and held me around my waist, my arms
pinned to my sides.

"We're not killers, Miss," he said, and his voice was incredibly calm.
"We have nothing to do with it."

I twisted free and struck at him, tearing skin from his face with my
nails. "_Weren't my parents enough?_"

One of them pointed another device at me, and I blacked out.
