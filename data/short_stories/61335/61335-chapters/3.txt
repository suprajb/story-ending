My laughter faded, blending with hers ... and then ... and then we were
no longer standing separately in the sun.

It was a dark night, the air fresh and cool to my skin, and the leaves
of the trees which stretched over us rustled with a faint wind.

I laughed again, a soft girlish sound that brought discomfort to the
boy's face before me.

"Your mother says. Your father says. Don't you ever say anything for
yourself, Bob?"

"Look, Rosalie, I'm sorry. Maybe I just don't think the way you do. My
father says sex at our age is just another escape from reality. You've
got to face yourself as an adult first. He--"

"Your father is a bigger nincompoop than you are!" I shouted at him. "I
thought you said you loved me. I thought you had some _feelings_ buried
under that so-called rational mind of yours! Or does your father say
you're too young to _love_ somebody?"

He tried to say something, but I was right. He pressed his lips
together and looked away. I was almost enjoying it now; with deliberate
coolness I buttoned up my tunic, feeling the soft fibers on my skin.

"How long does it take to love somebody?" I said, but my voice was
beginning to tremble. I turned away from his still figure in the night,
and began the slow walk back along the path to the house. Tears stung
my eyes, and spilled onto my cheeks; I started to run through the dark.

I slammed the door when I ran in, and went directly to my room. At
one end of it was a small studio, where an easel was lit coldly by
a fluorescent light. Almost blindly I began beating my fists on the
still-wet canvas, blurring and then ripping the nearly finished
portrait of a young man.
