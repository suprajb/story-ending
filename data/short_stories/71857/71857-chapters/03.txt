_The ruby rolled across the table and fell to the floor._

He was sitting before the table again without any memory of having left
the bathroom! It had happened _twice_.

Taking the globe to the window, he examined it carefully and saw that
where the ruby had been lodged, there was now an opening through the
metal. When he held it at a certain angle, he saw a maze of wiring and
tiny mechanisms inside.

He had fought the Martians for two years. He had traveled across their
red deserts, crawled on the muddy bottoms of their gigantic dead
canals, walked through the remains of their ancient cities and heard
legends about the great Martian empire that had slowly crumbled during
the centuries.

He remembered the legends about Martian time machines and he accepted
the fact readily: the object in his hand was a time trap. An ancient,
intricate, scientific booby-trap!

The Martian had known he would die and had deliberately planned his
revenge. Perhaps the machine wasn't strong enough to take anyone far
into the past or future; that would explain why he hadn't used it to
escape. But it was evidently strong enough to be used as a trap, and
perhaps it had even been designed for that purpose centuries ago.
Removing the ruby had triggered it....

Ironic, he reflected, that he'd gone to so much trouble and expense to
smuggle the thing from Mars to Earth. The jewels were worth a fortune
and it had never occurred to him that the metal globe might have some
_function_. Actually, he had smuggled an ingenious death-trap back to
Earth with him.

He shuddered at the thought.
