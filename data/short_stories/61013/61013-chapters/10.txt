Well, a couple more weeks to bleach, a little wiring, and I'll be
heading East. Look for the billboards:

                               MR. BONES
                     The Fastest Draw in the West
                      "Faster than Billy the Kid
                          and Twice as Dead"
                             presented by
                            HIRAM PERTWEE,
                                 M.D.

All I've got to do is figure how to keep getting mad at Jake.
