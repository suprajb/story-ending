The question wasn't as all-fired pip-witted as Jake was capable of. It
took me upwards of three weeks to work out why a weapon that could
draw and aim itself didn't shoot too.

I'd heard a little clink when the weapon flew into the skeleton's hand.
It came from a metal disk that lay in its palm, toward the heel of the
hand.

The disk was thin and only about as big as a two-cent piece. A mate to
it was set in the butt of the umbrella handle, convex where the other
was concave.

Going at it kind of gingerly, I slid the disk in my vest behind my
watch and put the umbrella handle in my right coat pocket.

It was a key-wind repeater with a gold hunting case, that watch, and
I worried about it every step down the mountain. I walked a good four
hundred yards behind Jake all the way back into town, just to be on the
safe side. We didn't linger, either. We wanted lights.

By the time I got the two objects locked in my rolltop my heartbeat in
anybody else would have had me telling the sexton to start his hole. I
prescribed bed for me, told Jake, who hadn't hardly even drawn breath
the whole time, to go to hell and retired.
