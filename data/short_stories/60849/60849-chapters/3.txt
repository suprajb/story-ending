"Hello, darling. How was the run?" she asked, kissing him as he came
into the house. "You only made fair time this evening. Something
happen?"

"No, pretty routine. Panthers are on the increase. I came across
three of them attacking a girl runner. Works as a copy writer in the
city. She claims that the jungle cured her ulcers completely. Really
remarkable."

"Mmm-hmm," said Virginia, taking his holster. "Attractive, no doubt. I
suppose she tried to seduce you. I've heard stories about those jungle
women."

"Nothing of the sort. Just suggested I drop in for a drink. After all,
she was grateful."

What nonsense, he told himself as he showered, Virginia suggesting that
the girl had intended to seduce him. Oh, well, what difference did it
make?

Man, that hot water felt good! Even on his scratched legs and arms.

How many years had he been making the run now? Twenty-three, almost. In
a way he could consider himself a sort of a pioneer. And to think that
the only reason he had started jungle running in the first place was to
please a supervisor! Those days everyone did it.

As he dried himself off, hearing the tinkle of cocktails in the living
room, he wondered if the panthers would move south, away from the water
hole, before tomorrow's run.
