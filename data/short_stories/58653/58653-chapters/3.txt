I found myself looking forward to his next visit. I looked and looked
and a month passed and a tall, serious-faced youth came into the
library and waited until I'd finished checking in Mrs. Garvey's returns.

"I understand," he said, "that you have an immense store of local
history in this library?"

"The section by the south window."

"Thank you." He peered at me through thick lenses. "Thank you Miss--"

"--Hopstead."

"Miss Hopstead. I am Nicholas Worthy. Possibly you knew a friend of
mine. Professor Waits? I am carrying on his work."

"Carrying on--? Did something happen to--?"

"Oh. Then you didn't hear. It was most tragic. Professor Waits died of
pneumonia. A great loss--a great loss."

I was deeply shocked. My feeling was that of losing a close friend.
"No, I hadn't heard. It must have been very sudden."

"It was. He was advanced in years, you know, and after he fell,
pneumonia set in quickly. They were unable to save him."

"The Professor had an accident?"

"Yes. He fell down the main staircase of the Reamer mansion and broke
his hip."
