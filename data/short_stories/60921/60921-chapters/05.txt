"I'd hoped to land in the middle of a library of some sort...." His
voice broke off. "You don't seem to have much of a collection of books
here."

Julia said, "Are you near the bookcase?"

"No wonder the records didn't last, if this is the way they were kept."

"Vassi, can you touch the books?" She got up and went to the bookcase.

"Yes."

"Pick one up."

"They're no use to me. This isn't history."

"Pick one up!"

"I haven't got the time. I have to move on."

"Vassi, you touched the faucet, didn't you? And you knocked on the
door."

"Yes.... That _does_ mean I can bring back artifacts!"

"Why can't you touch me?"

"Now I have to get to a place that will do me some good. A library, a
store, isn't that what you call them? A museum.... Are any of these
things nearby?"

"Let me go with you. I'll be your guide. I'll--I'll show you my time."

"But won't you be uncomfortable? I'm invisible."

"I don't care! No one can steal you from me this way."

"Steal me?"

"Vassi, why can't you touch me!"

"I'm not too sure. I think it's because you're alive. You see, life is
a transient thing. Matter is continuous in one form or another. Matter
existing today always existed and will always exist, or something like
that. I didn't listen too carefully. Anyhow, it's possible for someone
to travel back in time but not ahead. Do I make myself clear? It's out
of my line, you know."

Julia reached down and scooped up Belle. "Can you touch her?"

"What is that?"

"My cat. Can you touch her?"

"A cat? My, the anatomists would love to see that! But it's the same as
with you. My hand passes right through her."

Julia put Belle back on the floor. Her mind was racing.

Vassi said, "She's sitting right where I'm standing."

"I've got to believe it's not a nightmare. I've got to believe you're
real and that you can help me."

"If I can do it quickly. I have so much else to do. Others are waiting
to use the machine."

"Are people well where you come from?"

"Very well, thank you."

"Are there any incurable diseases?" She tried to listen for his
breathing.

"Incurable? You mean sickness that doesn't respond to treatment? No, of
course not."

"Then take me with you!" she cried.

"You just said you wanted to guide me here."

"Take me with you to your time."

"I can't do that. I can't even touch you."

"There must be a way. You have got to think of something."

"Even if I could take you, I'm not supposed to."

"Why?"

"It would mix up history to remove persons from their time. It might
even be dangerous with artifacts. I suppose we couldn't hold onto them
very long."

"History? I have no history. I'm going to die very soon. No one depends
on me. I have no one. Please take me, Vassi."

"I feel very strange."

"Are you all right?"

"Yes. I just feel--odd."

"How...."

"First you want to guide me, then you want to come with me, you don't
care about mankind's survival. You sound so terrified and confused."
