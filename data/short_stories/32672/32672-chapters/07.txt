"That can't be helped," the voice said stiffly.

I shook my head. "I think you got a loony," I said. "But don't quote

look in again a little later. Hope you get rid of your pest."

"We'd better," Mike moaned dismally.

"Brother," Mort declared, pulling his hair and making a sincerely
distraught face, "you're not kidding!"

I looked at the telephone booth and shook my head. "Somebody is," I
told them....
