But Toolls was wrong. They had forgotten one thing. A minor detail,
relatively....

On Toolls' world his race, in the course of its evolution, had adjusted
itself to its own particular environment. Logically, the final result
was that they evolved into beings best able to survive in that
environment. As such their food--a "heavy," highly concentrated
food--was ideally suited to supply the needs of their "heavy,"
tremendously avid organisms.

Orville Pollnow had no such food available. His body--no larger than
before--had an Earth mass of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. One
hundred and eighty thousand pounds--the weight of twelve hundred average
sized men--of fiercely burning, intense virility. Even continuous
eating--of his own world's food--could not supply the demands of that
body.

Twenty-four hours after the aliens left, Pollnow was dead--of
starvation.
