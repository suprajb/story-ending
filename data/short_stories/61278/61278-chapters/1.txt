Wednesday evening, when he opened the door to chill some beer, there
was a package in the freezing compartment. He took out the package.

It was some sort of plastic and appeared to contain fish eggs.

Coxe had not seen fresh fish eggs, considered by some a delicacy, for
a number of years.

He chilled the beer and fried the eggs.

Both tasted about right.
