The refrigerator worked perfectly, and he began to stock it with things
freezers are conventionally stocked with.

It was almost two weeks after the last package had appeared, early one
Sunday morning, when the doorbell rang.

At the door was a small, nondescript man with a vaguely--and really
indefinably--unpleasant aspect. His head was bandaged.

"Mr. Coxe?" he asked.

"That's me."

"May I come in?"

"Come on."

The man seated himself. "Something terrible has happened," he said. "A
horrible mistake has been made."

"I'm sorry to hear that. You look as if you were in an accident."

"I was. I've been in the ... hospital ... for nearly two months. But
to come to the point, Mr. Coxe. I've come about the refrigerator you
recently purchased. It was a special refrigerator that was erroneously
shipped out of the plant as a second. When I didn't come in, it got
shipped out and sold."

"Good refrigerator," Coxe said.

"Perhaps you've noticed ... ah ... something unusual about it?"

"It runs okay. For a while there were a bunch of packages of fish eggs
in it."

"Fish eggs!" the little man cried in horror. After he had recovered
sufficiently, he asked, "You do, of course you do, I'm sure you still
have all the ... little packages?"

"Oh, no," said Coxe.

"NO? Oh, my God. What did you do with them, Mr. Coxe?"

"Ate them."

"You ... ate ... them? Ate--? No. You didn't. Not all of them. You
couldn't have done that, Mr. Coxe. Please tell me that you could not
have done that."

"I had to give a lot of them away, and everybody said they were
delicious. And really.... Uh, Mr.--? Mr., uh...."

The little man got unsteadily to his feet. His face was ashen. "This is
horrible, horrible." He stumbled to the door. "You are a fiend. All our
work ... all our plans ... and you, you...." He turned to Coxe. "I hate
you. Oh, I hate you."

"Now, see here."

"... Mr. Coxe, you'll never realize the enormity of your crime. _You've
eaten all of us!_" With that, he slammed the door and was gone.

Coxe went back to the other room.

"Who was it, honey?"

"Ah, some nut. Seems he had first claim on the refrigerator."

"I'll bet it was about the fish eggs."

"Yeah, he wanted them."

"Oh, dear. Do you think he can do anything to us?"

"I don't think so, not now. It's too late," Coxe concluded. "We ate
them all."
