Paul passed up the bus, preferring to walk the ten blocks to his
apartment. He needed the air and the sense of freedom was glorious.
Thank heaven his mind had come unstuck that last moment and now the
sheaf of money was back where it belonged--in the satchel of the
armored car guard. Humbled, completely chastened and not a little
scared, Paul hoped he had caused no one any inconvenience.

And strong indeed were his resolutions: no more mental transference. In
fact no more martinis. From now on he would get his money the hard way.
In the end that would turn out to be by far the easiest.
