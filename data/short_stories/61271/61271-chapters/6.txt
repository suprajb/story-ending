Keller went down immediately.

**What?** No response. **WHAT?** Still no response. Then he could hear
her cry--fading in depth--now dying--gone.

**Radcliffe.**

Mememe.

**Sally.**

Memeususwetwowetwo....

It had happened. Sally was trapped in his preconscious, absorbed by
his dominating mind block. Gone.

Forever.

Determination, savage and enraged. A desperate shot in the dark:

**RADCLIFFE!**

Mememememememe....

**Radcliffe, I am the MAN WHO FLEW.**

Nononono. Fear. Terror. Hate. Block. Withdrawal, but incomplete....

Coming out of his Probe, Keller saw the result of his last implanted
thought: Radcliffe, now in a tight fetal ball, lay on the floor.

His face was absolutely devoid of expression. His conscious mind was a
constant _gobble-gobble-gobble_.

Keller entered the next room, to find Sally sprawled limply across
her desk. Mindless, soulless, as if she had never had a mind or
soul--Keller lifted her tenderly onto the floor and chose the most
merciful way out, disintegrating her body with an atomic gun from the
closet.

Then, again, the Probe....

**Radcliffe.**

Mememe.

**I'm Sally.**

Nonono. (Gloating.) Gonegonegone.

**Radcliffe, _where's Sally_?**

Gone. Satisfaction. Triumph. Laughter. Delirious happiness.

**Radcliffe, I'm everything. I'm the creature. The snake, THE MAN WHO
FLEW, the hole in the air, the flames, everything you've hated, feared
and dreaded.**

Withdrawal. Thunderbolt! More and more now.

Frantically, Keller defended himself, throwing up block after block,
only to have it torn down by the ever-spreading bolts of pure mental
energy. Finally he withdrew into his own body in haste, realizing that
Radcliffe's conquest would mean his revival.
