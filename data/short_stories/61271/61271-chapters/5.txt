In about twenty minutes, Radcliffe barged in as before. "Keller," he
said, "I think I'm going to be called out of town tonight. So if you
want any more information directly from me, you'll have to get it now."

Keller flashed: **Sally. Watch his conscious thoughts, and also his
impressions. I'm going to try some unconscious identification-response.
Wish me luck. Or do you want to burrow around in his subconscious with
me a little more?**

**I think I will. I'm actually beginning to enjoy it, to tell the
truth.**

Keller said aloud, "I'll go under again. That'll be the last time."

**Radcliffe, I am the creature.**

No! Dead. You're not--I hate you--gone. Disbelief. Hate. No fear.
Forgetfulness. Block. Withdrawal.

**Radcliffe.**

Me.

**I'm the melting walls.**

Terror? Uncertainty. Indecision. Realization. Contemptpityscorn. Sharp
mental block. Withdrawal.

**Radcliffe.**

Me.

**I'm the teddy bear.** (This was, he thought, Radcliffe's wife-image.)

Indecision. Realization. Withdrawal. Blank.

**Radcliffe, I'm the hole in the air.**

But Keller's reply was cut short by a cry of terror in his brain.

**RICK!**

It was Sally.
