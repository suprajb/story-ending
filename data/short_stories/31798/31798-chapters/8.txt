Ronny picked up the empty glass that had held his chocolate milk from
the back steps where he had left it and went inside. As he stepped
into the kitchen, he knew what another kitchen had looked like for a
five-year-old child who had been Purcell ninety years ago. There had
been an iron sink, and a brown-and-green-spotted faucet, and the glass
had been heavier and transparent, like real glass.

Ronny reached up and put the colored plastic tumbler down.

"That was a nice young man, dear. What did he say to you?"

Ronny looked up at his mamma, comparing her with the remembered mamma
of fifty years ago. He loved the other one, too.

"He tol' me he's glad I play Indian."
