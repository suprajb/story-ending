It was ten minutes later that Pop Gillette and Joe sat drinking their
Venusian wine again, watching the ground crews welding a new plate on
the liner, a mile away across the Port.

"But how did you do it?" Joe asked. "And why the scotch tape?"

Pop Gillette deftly poured a tumbler of wine down his throat and
reached for the bottle.

"Simplest thing in the world. I used the tape to stick a couple of bed
sheets over the hole, inside and out."

Joe stared at him in puzzlement.

"Bedsheets? What for?"

Pop Gillette cast his eyes heavenwards as for deliverance. "I'm sure
glad I don't run a liner anymore. I might get somebody like you for a
co-pilot. I had to have a _mold_, didn't I? You heard the pilot say
the patch had to be metal to stand the pressure. Fifteen pounds to the
inch over a ten foot patch is a lot of pressure. Well, after I had the
sheets over the hole, I turned it towards the sun, filled the mold, and
turned it around away from the sun. The temperature drop in space did
the rest."

Joe put his hand to his brow and glanced at his wine glass
suspiciously. "I vaguely get what you're talking about, but just _what_
did you make the patch out of?"

Pop Gillette chuckled wryly.

"The mercury, of course. Froze hard as steel when I turned her away
from the sun. Perfect fit, too."
