"You've figured out how to let him know that you won't marry him?"

"I'll tell him when he comes down."

"And you think that just telling him will do the trick, Suzy?"

"The way I'll tell him, it'll stick, oh it'll stick all right." Suzy
choked off the last words, and blinked back the tears that seemed to
come into her eyes.

"I'm glad you've got it figured out, dear." Miss Graham said
approvingly. "His orbit got knocked loose somehow, and he'll be in this
evening, to talk things over."

Suzy gasped. "So soon? I mean, well, I've got it sort of figured, but,
well," she paused, collecting her thoughts. "As well now as ever, I
guess. I'll wait for him."

"Do you think he'd get violent? I could leave a couple of engineers in
the closet, or maybe you'd like to have Sheila...."

"No, I can handle him, and I'd rather not have Sheila here when he comes
in. I'll handle him. And thank you, Miss Graham."

The door closed on Miss Graham's back, and Suzy began to think of Whit
Clayborne.
