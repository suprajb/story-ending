Next day, I brought home a sample programming sheet for her to see and
damned if she didn't dismiss it with a sniff as being too complicated
and boring.

Go figure women out!

That night, we had two molded gelatin dishes. The round kind with a
hole in the center.

The next night, we had the same kind of supper, except that instead of
fish and something in gelatin, we had meat and something in gelatin.
Same sort of deal for dessert.

The next day, I got my first tip that something was up when Willie
Kipe, the caster for NYC-TV, called me and asked about the protest on
the Central Park roofing proposal, saying he got the item from his
woman assistant. I said it didn't amount to much and that the project
was going ahead on schedule.

I caught Willie's cast that night and he treated it in a light manner
which really made me smile. I should have been crying instead.

That night, we had some more molded gelatin, only in square molds this
time. Same thing the next day. I figured it was time to take a stand--a
diplomatic one, of course.

"Honey," I said as I sat toying with my food, "can't we have different
dishes every night? I'm getting tired of all this gelatin junk. How
about a steak?"

"But, darling, gelatin is very good for you. It's simply crammed full
of protein and all the girls at the club are eating lots of gelatin."

"But I don't like gelatin _that_ well," I said.

"I don't, either, but it's so good for _both_ of us," she said with her
best don't-try-to-argue-Mother-knows-best smile.

I had a steak that night after she went to bed.
