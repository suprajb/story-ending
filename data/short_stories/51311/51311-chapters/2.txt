When I got home that night, I didn't say anything about Hatty Dakkon.
My wife is inclined to see things differently than I do and I had a
hunch she would side with Hatty. Consequently, rather than get into a
discussion, I just let it slide.

Not too many of you boys know my wife, but those who do know that
she is like so many other women--not particularly interested in any
Civic Machine. Just so she gets what she wants when she dials the home
connection to the Machine is all she is interested in.

That night, though, my wife surprised me by having a burning interest
in the Civic Machine. She wanted to know all about it. How it produces
the consumer products. How it gets them to the living area. How it
knows what to order. And she especially quizzed me about the new
Projector.

When I asked her why she wanted to know about all that after 15 years
of married life, she just smiled sweetly and said that naturally she
was interested in my work.
