They have a new Projector up at Schenectady, same as we have, and it
ordered an increase in the size of the mold-making factory based on our
demand (which was run in with everyone else's demand). Then, when the
demand didn't come through from us and from the other cities in the
area, we had to pay the premium for building the new factory.

The scissors business would have bankrupted us completely. Think of
it--millions of pairs of steel scissors in the year 2006! Think of
the premium for increase in size of factory, prospecting the planets,
mining, spaceship freight rates, and so forth. That's why I was glad to
give up the Central Park project.

Well, to make a long story short, we aren't going near Central Park.
And Charlie, who originally thought of the idea, is probably out there
now, wondering why he did it.

Now in closing, I hope all the rest of you who have had a good laugh
will sober up and sympathize with me and see what you can do about
ordering gelatin molds from us. We'll ship them out pronto--we have a
large supply--and no reasonable offer will be refused. Please, fellows!
