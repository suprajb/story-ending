He uncoiled. The dry pop of hardened joints jabbed wakefulness into him
until finally the twenty-foot long shell lay straight upon the steaming
rocks. He opened his eyes, all of them, one by one.

Across the bubbling pools, far away, past the white stone geysers, he
could see them coming. Many of them, swiftly, giant slithering things
with many arms and many legs.

He tried to move, but rock grew over him and he could not move. By
looking around he could see the cliff's edge, and he remembered the
thousand bottomless pits below. Gradually the rest formed, and he
remembered all.

He turned to the largest creature. "Did you tell them?" He knew this
would be a horrible punishment, worse than the last, the burning, far
worse. Fingers began to unhinge the thick shell, peel it from him,
leaving the viscous white tenderness bare to the heat and pain. "Tell
them, make them understand, this is only a dream I'm having--"

They took the prisoner to the precipice, lingered a moment to give him
a view of the dizziness and the sucking things far below. Then nervous
hands pressed him forward into space.

He did not wake for a long time.
