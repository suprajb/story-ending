The clock bonged the quarter hour. Fifteen to twelve. Max Kaplan wiped
the perspiration from his forehead.

"And besides," Ritchie said, somewhat too loudly, "it's plain
ridiculous. He says--what? We're a dream he's having, right? Okay--then
what about our parents, and their parents, everybody who never heard of
the kid?"

"First thing I thought of. And you know his answer."

Ritchie snorted.

"Well, think it over, for God's sake. He says _every_ dream is a
complete unit in itself. You--haven't you ever had nightmares about
people you'd never seen before?"

"Yes, I suppose so, but--"

"All right, even though they were projections of your subconscious--or
whatever the hell it's called--they were complete, weren't they? Going
somewhere, doing something, all on their own?"

Ritchie was silent.

"Where were they going, what were they doing? See? The kid says every
dream, even ours, builds its own whole world--complete, with a past
and--as long as you stay asleep--a future."

"Nonsense! What about _us_, when _we_ sleep and dream? Or is the period
when we're unconscious the time _he's_ up and around? And keep in mind
that everybody doesn't sleep at the same time--"

"You're missing the point, Hank. I said it was complete, didn't I? And
isn't sleeping part of the pattern?"

"Have another drink, Max. You're slipping."
