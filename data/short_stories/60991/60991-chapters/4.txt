By the excellence of her father, he and I continued to be good friends.
At least once a year I invite him to view the master's painting of
_Planet_. We spend many contented hours together. Often through a
porthole we watch the rapid movement of distant ships which our
Navigator called _stars_, revolving in tiny circles at the side of the
ship, making a complete circle in about two minutes. What prompts the
behavior of these ships? It is all very curious, and I account myself
fortunate that I have in my friend an intense capacity for speculation.
Like myself, he is a scholar of honor, capable of long sustained
discourse on lofty subjects which round out and deepen the mind. I
forgive him his greed.

As I had intended, Lisa took the teletype nonsense message to be
her value to her father. May I reiterate, it is infinitely more
satisfactory to purchase wives when they are very young ladies? They
are vastly more respectful. Admittedly they are saucy.
