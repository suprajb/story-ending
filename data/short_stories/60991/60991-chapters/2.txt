"Shall I bargain with _her_ then?" I asked my friend caustically. I
will own I was vexed.

Shrewdly he nodded. "Whatever she accepts will be our bargain." Then,
laughing at my undignified discomfiture, "It is manifest she is more
aware of her value than I."

"Will you be serious? It is not kindly to banter with a woman-child in
such an important matter as her future."

But greed now fully possessed him. "I do not joke. Whatever she demands
shall be her price." He sipped his sweet wine, hiding his eyes from my
displeasure.

Concealing my fury, I turned to Lisa, who now sat up straight on the
narrow couch with her long, slender legs folded under her. In the pace
of grievous mortification I was not bitter toward her. It was not her
fault. For her I extended the tolerance due the innocent.

"What is your cost, child?" I asked. "This control knob and other-ship
vision of our Navigator are sufficient to purchase any girl-woman. What
will you have?"

Lisa chewed her gum slowly while she formed her serene thought. Then,
shaking her oval head, she let fall in a dreamy, singsong voice,
"Neither of these! Neither of these!"

Her father leaned forward anxiously. I told her, "There is a limit to
your value. I will not give all of my treasures for you, lovely though
you are. Choose what thing you will have, and if I can procure it, your
father shall have it."

"I'll know it when I see it!" she said, smiling impudently.
