Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,
studied Wayne with abstract interest.

"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?"

"Yes, sir."

"But you couldn't execute them?"

"No, sir."

"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?"

"Yes, sir."

"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl
killed her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can
be done for them? That they have to be executed?"

"I know."

"Too bad," the doctor said. "We all have aggressive impulses, primitive
needs that must be expressed early, purged. There's murder in all
of us, Seton. The impulse shouldn't be denied or suppressed, but
_educated_. The state used to kill them. Isn't it better all around,
Seton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,
Seton?"

"I--felt sorry for her."

"Is that all you can say about it?"

"Yes, sir."

The doctor pressed a buzzer. Two men in white coats entered.

"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it's still
in there. I can't turn you out and have it erupt later--and maybe shed
clean innocent blood, can I?"

"No, sir," Wayne mumbled. He didn't look up. "I'm sorry I punked out."

"Give him the treatment," the doctor said wearily. "And send him back
to his mother."

Wayne nodded and they led him away. His mind screamed still to split
open some prison of bone and lay bare and breathing wide. But there
was no way out for the trapped. Now he knew about the old man and his
poker-playing pals.

They had all punked out.

Like him.
