Yes, I know, said Leonard Sale, lying there. But what else?

_Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh_, said a voice.

I know that, also, said Leonard Sale, irritably. He turned cold. His
mouth hung open wildly.

"I am Tylle of Rathalar, Killer of Men!"

"I am Iorr of Wendillo, Destroyer of Infidels!"

What is this place? asked Leonard Sale, struggling against horror.

"Once a mighty planet!" said Tylle of Rathalar.

"Once a place of battles!" said Iorr of Wendillo.

"Now dead," said Tylle.

"Now silent," said Iorr.

"Until _you_ came," said Tylle.

"To give us life again," said Iorr.

You're dead, insisted Leonard Sale, flesh writhing. You're nothing but
empty wind.

"We live, through you."

"And fight, through _you_!"

So that's it, thought Leonard Sale. I'm to be a battleground, am I? Are
you friends?

"Enemies!" cried Iorr.

"Foul enemies!" cried Tylle.
