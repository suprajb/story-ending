I waited, when the German courier ceased, to hear something said of this
strange story.  The silence was unbroken.  I looked round, and the five
couriers were gone: so noiselessly that the ghostly mountain might have
absorbed them into its eternal snows.  By this time, I was by no means in
a mood to sit alone in that awful scene, with the chill air coming
solemnly upon meâ€”or, if I may tell the truth, to sit alone anywhere.  So
I went back into the convent-parlour, and, finding the American gentleman
still disposed to relate the biography of the Honourable Ananias Dodger,
heard it all out.
