The Martians intercepted the emergency life-rocket at 5199CVZ. The
Morgue Ship itself was nowhere visible. It had already completed its
arc and was driving back toward Earth.

The body of Lazarus was hurried into the hospital cubicle of the
Martian rocket. The body was laid upon a table, and immediate efforts
were made to bring it out of its centuries of rest.

Lazarus reclined, silver uniform belted across the middle with soft
mouse-grey leather, bronze symbol 51 over the heart.

Breathlessly, the Martians crowded in about the body, probing,
examining, trying, waiting. The room got very warm. The little purple
eyes blinked hot and tensed.

Lazarus was breathing deeply now, sighing into full aware life, Lazarus
coming from the tomb. After three hundred years of avoid death.

Armed guards stood on both sides of the medical table, weapons poised,
torture mechanisms ready to make Lazarus speak if he refused to tell.

The eyes of Lazarus fluttered open. Lazarus out of the tomb. Lazarus
seeing his companions, iris widening upon itself, forcing shape out of
mist. Seeing the curious blue skulls of anxious Martians collected in a
watching crowd about him. Lazarus living, breathing, ready to speak.

Lazarus lifted his head, curiously, parted his lips, wetted them with
his tongue, and then spoke. His first words were:

"What time is it?"

It was a simple sentence, and all of the Martians bent forward to catch
its significance as one of the Martians replied:

"23:45."

Lazarus nodded and closed his eyes and lay back. "Good. He's safe then,
by now. He's safe."

The Martians closed in, waiting for the next important words of the
waking dead.

Lazarus kept his eyes closed, and he trembled a little, as if, in spite
of himself, he couldn't help it.

He said:

"_My name is Brandon._"

Then, Lazarus laughed....
