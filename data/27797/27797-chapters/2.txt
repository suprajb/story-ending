In the studio dressing room, a few hours later Milt and Frankie were
warming up. Frankie in the practice ring and Milt perched on a high
chair just outside the ropes.

Everything was just as it would be in the fight. Three minutes work, one
minute rest. Frankie noticed how slowly and carefully Milt was working
him, and how he watched the clock.

Frankie had nothing to do now but watch, as a spectator would; watch as
Milt moved him around. Milt could control every muscle, every move and
every reflex of his body. It had taken them five years to perfect this
routine. That was the training period at the College of Boxing, and was
prescribed by law.

In their first fight they had been at their peak. Frankie was Milt's
second boy and Milt knew boxing as only a Champion Welter with thirty
years of experience could know it. For fifteen years he had watched and
studied while a good veteran had directed his body. And for another
fifteen years he had been the guiding brain to a fine Middleweight.

As a Welterweight, Milt had learned to depend on speed and quick hands.
In Frankie he had found the dream of every Welter--a punch. Frankie's
body could really deliver the power. At first, it had been the heavy
hitting that had won the fights; lately, Milt had relied more and more
on the speed and deception he had developed in Frankie.
