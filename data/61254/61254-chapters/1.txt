"Moon in 14Â° Pisces," said the little perforated card. Henderson
stepped back from the computer and scratched his hairy head. Nonsense
again. He threw the card in the wastebasket and repeated his directions
on another:

"One hundred fifty cancer susceptible mice were injected in the
pectoral region with 1/cc of aromatic compound A. One hundred fifty
identical control mice were injected with isotonic saline, B. Eight in
group A developed sarcomas at the point of injection, Group B developed
none. Test the null hypothesis at 5% level of statistical significance."

The computer accepted Henderson's second offering, chewed it
into acceptable code, swallowed it, and burped. Henderson watched
suspiciously as red and green blinkers went on and off and a contented
humming noise came from the machine's bowels. After a while the card
emerged from another opening--which orifice had been thoughtfully
placed at the appropriate end of the machine, anatomically speaking;
thus establishing rapport between Henderson, a biologist, and nature's
final product of evolution, the machine.

Henderson looked at the card: "Today you should seek solace with close
friends. Give some thought to personal finances. Evening: get out and
see people. A stranger will bring news."
