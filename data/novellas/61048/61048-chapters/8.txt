April fields stretched darkly away on either side of the highway.
Presently she turned down a rutted road between two of them and they
bounced and swayed back to a black blur of trees. "Here we are," she
said.

Gradually he made out the sphere. It blended so flawlessly with its
background that he wouldn't have been able to see it at all if he
hadn't been informed of its existence. A gangplank sloped down from an
open lock and came to rest just within the fringe of the trees.

Lights danced in the darkness behind them as another car jounced down
the rutted road. "Jilka," Kay said. "I wonder if she got him."

Apparently she had. At least there was a man with her--a rather
woebegone, wilted creature who didn't even look up as they passed.
Quidley watched them ascend the gangplank, the man in the lead, and
disappear into the ship.

"Next," Kay said.

Quidley shook his head. "You're not taking _me_ to another planet!"

She opened her purse and pulled out a small metallic object "A
little while ago you asked me what a _snoll doper_ was," she said.
"Unfortunately interstellar law severely limits us in our choice of
marriageable males, and we can take only those who refuse to conform
to the sexual mores of their own societies." She did something to the
object that caused it to extend itself into a long, tubular affair.
"_This_ is a _snoll doper_."

She prodded his ribs. "March," she said.

He marched. Halfway up the plank he glanced back over his shoulder for
a better look at the object pressed against his back.

It bore a striking resemblance to a shotgun.
