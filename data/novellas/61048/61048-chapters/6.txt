Her voice seemed to come from far away, but she was standing right
beside him, tall and bewitching; Helenesque as ever. Her blue eyes
became great wells into which he found himself falling. With an effort,
he pulled himself back. "You're early tonight," he said lamely.

She appropriated the message, read it. "Put the book back," she said
presently. Then, when he complied: "Come on."

"Where are we going?"

"I'm going to deliver a _snoll doper_ to Jilka. After that I'm going to
take you home to meet my folks."

The relieved sigh he heard was his own.

They climbed into her convertible and she nosed it into the moving line
of cars. "How long have you been reading my mail?" she asked.

"Since the night before I met you."

"Was that the reason you spilled the sugar?"

"Part of the reason," he said. "What's a _snoll doper_?"

She laughed. "I don't think I'd better tell you just yet."

He sighed again. "But if Jilka wanted a _snoll doper_," he said after a
while, "why in the world didn't she call you up and say so?"

"Regulations." She pulled over to the curb in front of a brick
apartment building. "This is where Jilka lives. I'll explain when I get
back."

He watched her get out, walk up the walk to the entrance and let
herself in. He leaned his head back on the seat, lit a cigarette and
exhaled a mixture of smoke and relief. On the way to meet her folks.
So it was just an ordinary secret society after all. And here he'd
been thinking that she was the key figure in a Martian plot to blow up
Earth--

Her _folks_!

Abruptly the full implication of the words got through to him, and he
sat bolt-up-right on the seat. He was starting to climb out of the car
when he saw Kay coming down the walk. Anyway, running away wouldn't
solve his problem. A complete disappearing act was in order, and a
complete disappearing act would take time. Meanwhile he would play
along with her.
