pleadingly.

He nodded slowly. "We can just do it. I'll check and recheck the
calculations meanwhile--get the dial settings exact. And the next
try--Well, it's make or break anyway." His voice was grim. "One more
chance, and we get it or we don't."

During that half hour he checked and counter-checked his figures until
he was as sure as possible to hit the exact instant in the past--the
instant when Corvo North had jotted down the lost formula.

At eleven-thirty, the headset was replaced on Corvo North's head. This
time his arms were left free and a pad of paper placed on his lap. His
fingers held a pencil. He leaned back and again closed his eyes.

Roger Kay turned the dials.

Corvo North's face tensed, then relaxed. His eyes remained closed. For
a half minute, aside from the faint hum from the machine, there was
utter stark silence in the laboratory. It was maddening.

Then a faint scratching sound. The others, holding their breath from
sheer suspense, saw the pencil in Corvo North's hand begin to move
across the pad. Three lines it wrote; stopped.

The formula!
