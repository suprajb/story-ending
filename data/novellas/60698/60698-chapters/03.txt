The clerk returned, empty-handed.

"My communications man thinks he can fix your comm--television set
so it will be all right, if you can bring us a technical manual on
television sets. I hate to ask you to go to such trouble--"

"What! You mean you've got a television repairman who doesn't have a
manual on the things?"

"Not on the type you need," said the clerk apologetically. "It wouldn't
matter what brand or trade name the manual applies to."

"Why can't you have your communications man go out and buy his own?"
demanded Ken. "Or order one?"

"Well--let's just say it would cause great inconvenience at this
time. Mr. Hanshaw, I realize it would inconvenience you also, so in
return for the favor I will be willing to give you, free, any item of
merchandise in the store."

"Fair enough," agreed Jack, his eyes gleaming. "I'll bring it tomorrow."

"Incidentally, sir, would your friend be interested in a purchase while
you are here?"

"No, absolutely not," said Ken, turning away.

Jack caught his arm. "Oh, come on, Ken! Price these things, anyhow.
You'll be astonished. Show Mr. Adaman something he can use."

"Mr. Adaman?" The clerk's eyes widened delightedly. "Why, sir, that's
my name, too. Edigo Adaman."

"Mine's Kenneth Adaman," said Ken shortly, but he showed more interest.

"It isn't a common name," said Edigo. "Are you by any chance a
merchant, Mr. Adaman?"

"You might say so. I'm a clerk in a men's clothing store."
