For two of the natives, each absorbed in his own purpose and
destination, had collided. Their dull faces lit up with momentary
glares of anger; then the customary lack of expression returned and
each continued on his apathetic way.

"Well, the poor things can't communicate," Jane sprang to the defense.
"Maybe they don't have vocal cords."

"Listen, shug," Ned said, "you don't have to have vocal chords in
order to communicate. There are other ways of getting a message across
besides talking."

"You mean like telepathy?"

"I mean like gestures, hitting a stone with a stick ... anything.
The only reason these things don't communicate is because they have
nothing to say."

"Anyhow, they do have vocal cords," Danny contributed. "Listen!"

One of the natives who had been in the collision had looked over his
shoulder for a parting glare at his opponent and had, therefore, run
smack into a third native who was gathering roots with his eyes on the
ground. Apparently this was too much for Native A. He threw a stone at
Native C. Native C uttered a hoarse cry of rage--which was what had led
Danny to deduce the existence of vocal cords in the species--and threw
a sizeable stone at Native A. Both stones missed their targets. Native
A and Native C continued on their respective ways, each glaring back
at the other. It was obvious that both would presently be involved in
similar encounters.

"Well," Judy commented, "they can communicate anger at any rate."
