There was a mushroom of sun-fire against the blackness of the cool
night, and a thunder of power.

Slowly, ponderously, the _White Whale_ backed down her column of flame,
hesitated, flared again for a final time from her thick stem, and then
settled to Earth.

Gantries rolled into position. And the sound of lock-hatches clanging
open thrilled the length of the _White Whale_, and there were the
muffled voices of men, and the voices became shouts with the joy loud
in them.

The men trooped down from their great metal monster as fast as the
lifts would carry them, and in small groups and in crowds they made
their boisterous way across the landing plaza and toward home.

And when the shouts had died, a last man descended the smooth sides of
the _White Whale_.

His eyes glanced over the great bulk of her, making certain she was
secure. Then he, too, walked from her, but not as quickly as the rest.

Captain Nicholas Joel walked slowly, because he was tired.

On every side of him, in dark shadow against the night, there were
tall, slender, streamlined shapes pointing toward the stars.

His slow boot-steps echoed from their hulls as he passed, a tiny midge
of a thing, between them.

As Sam had said, these were things that Man had made.

And among them again was the _White Whale_.

They had said he was a good pilot.
