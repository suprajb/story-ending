                     THE $1000 PRIZE WINNING STORY
                in IF's College Science Fiction Contest

_Here is the best story submitted in answer to the theme question:
"What Will Life in America Be Like 100 Years From Now?" ... Written by
an undergraduate at the University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky,
it pictures the America of 2054 as part of a world empire run by an
Italian dictator and very similar to that of the ancient Caesars and
the early Roman Empire. There is one language, one religion and customs
and laws have changed to suit the times. But, basically, human nature
hasn't changed and there is the omnipresent clash of faction against
faction. The theme is that a dictatorship is the only perfect form of
government. If there is a moral, it is that there is no permanent form
of government._

_One of the requirements for entering IF's College Science Fiction
Contest was that the contestant be a "simon pure" amateur--never
having been published professionally. This is Andy Offut's first
published story, and it has been accorded the same editing we give to
professional manuscripts. No rewriting or revisions have been made. See
November IF for complete announcement of this and the six other winners
in this nation-wide contest._
