The detachment of soldiers from the garrison at Tel Aviv stopped and
looked around.

"Sir, what is it?" asked a guard anxiously.

"Terribly quiet out here; something's up," the Lieutenant muttered
calmly.

There were seven of them. The Lieutenant, the Centurion, and five
legionaries. They had grown accustomed to the quiet life of garrison
men in a calm, conquered city. When there is nothing tangible to be
guarded, a guard's life is a dull one. The guns they carried were
the symbol of their authority, and had never been used for any other
purpose.

They looked around. The dirty, once-white buildings rose close on
either side. There was no moon. There was no sound. The darkness and
the silence could have been cut with a knife.

The Lieutenant grinned. He didn't feel much like grinning. He spoke. He
didn't feel much like talking, either.

"This darkness is thick," he said. "You could cut it with a knife. Wish
I had a knife."

He got a knife. The men had just started to laugh when the Lieutenant
got it.

Between his shoulder blades.

As the Lieutenant toppled forward, the Centurion dodged close against
the dirty stone wall and yelled "Spread out!"

They killed a lot of the shadowy, green-clad attackers, but there were
only six of them and they were cornered. When the enemy drove a tank
into the alley and sprayed them with its mounted gun they died.

"Take their weapons," said a quiet voice.
