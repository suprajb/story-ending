Twenty-eight years later, on Earth, an astronomer comparing recent
plates taken of the constellation Lyra noticed that Vega, its brightest
star, had increased in brightness by a slight amount. The event was
not especially remarkable--there are on the average, twenty-five novas
reported every year in our galaxy--but Vega was one of the stars to
be visited during the next decade by one of the Survey ships now in
mid-voyage.

"There's one place they won't have to stop, now," he said to a
colleague, showing him the plates.

"I don't suppose it matters. What's one star, more or less, when they
all turn out to be the same--no planets, or barren ones--no stopping
place for man."

"I suppose you're right," said the astronomer, staring glumly at the
waste immensity of the photograph in front of him.
