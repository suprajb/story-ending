The Genocide Squad was the first to go into the crater.

The last warrior had ceased moving. Later the salvagers would come to
collect the precious metals. They drilled Jord's machine open but,
luckily, by this time he was dead.

"Which one next?" he asked, clambering awkwardly from the hole in the
machine's back. He was a native and, except for certain functional
differences in his construction, was little distinguished from other
natives. But normalcy is relative. The normalcy of a native may be
radically different from that of a fortress dweller.

"We are fortunate the bomb didn't destroy more of these bodies," he
said, rejoining his partner at the side of the warrior.

"What is it like, inside?" his partner asked curiously.

The Genocide Monitor stopped for a moment and appraised the vast bulk.
He had long ago ceased to be either fascinated or repelled by the soft,
unfunctional bodies of fortress dwellers.

"Just another human," the android said.
