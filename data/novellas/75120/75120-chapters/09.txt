Utter blackness lay over all the world. To the right there was the
long, low pestilential coast where Sunaku held sway, where any white
man was fair game and Gleason would be prized more than most. To the
left was open sea, from which only swells came rolling in unendingly.
Ahead was emptiness. Behind was the dull rumble of devil-devil drums
in half a dozen villages whose warriors were hunting Gleason--and,
nearer, the splashing paddles of a canoe. By the splashings and the
tempo, the paddlers were weary to exhaustion. But the canoe drew
steadily nearer.

Gleason swung off his course and cursed his men in a whisper. He let
the boat rock and roll in the darkness without a paddle lifted, and
the following canoe went on past. And then the whaleboat sped on
toward the shore to resume its course.

But presently the dreary splashing of paddles in the hands of
exhausted men sounded once more in the darkness. A voice called,
startlingly close. Maehoe’s voice. In a frenzy, Gleason shot at it.

And that shot was heard on shore.

In half an hour the heavens were echoing the dull, monotonous booming
of a devil-devil drum ahead, and word was passing through the bush in
the mysterious fashion of bush-wireless, of Gleason’s presence and his
new course. And, of course, the sea was swarming with hunting
war-boats.
