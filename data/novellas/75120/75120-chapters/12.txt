Gleason fled. He fumbled with the dynamite sticks. They were wet. The
dynamite was useless. He flung it aside. He plucked at the revolver
shells. Wrong! For Maehoe had the revolver, and was essaying to hold
off the pursuing bushboys as a desirous member of the Native
Constabulary Force of the Solomon Island Protectorate should do. But
Maehoe was dead before the first bushboy appeared.

An arrow slithered across the way before Gleason. It missed him by
inches only. He snapped a shot from his own weapon and panted on. He
saw a hideous face, tattooed out of all semblance of humanity, with
goggle-like circles painted in white about its eyes. It vanished before
he could fire. He saw another, and another....

Gleason began to scream. He emptied his revolvers and had no more
shells. He flung the useless things aside and began to run. And
suddenly he was laughing. Henderson had said, “The wicked flee when no
man pursueth.” He’d repeated it and re-repeated it until it became a
tiresome saw. Henderson was wrong.

Gleason howled with hysterical laughter as he fled like a deer from
the men who hunted him earnestly. Even Maehoe had quoted the thing at
him. “The wicked flee when no man pursueth.” But they were wrong, now.
He was fleeing, all right, but men were pursuing him. The jungle was
full of the noise of the chase. Men were pursuing him, all right....

And they caught him.
