When he returned to Earth, his book, _Underlying Causes of the Implicit
Inferiority of Non-Terran Peoples_, was hailed as a milestone in
comparative anthropology. But he ran into some difficulty almost at
once.

A space captain named Jones returned to Earth and maintained that,
on the planet Loray, he had discovered a native who was in every
significant way the equal of a Terran. And he had tape recordings and
motion pictures to prove it.

Carver's thesis seemed in doubt for some time, until Carver examined
the evidence for himself. Then he pointed out, with merciless logic,
that the so-called super-Lorayan, this paragon of Loray, this supposed
equal of Terran humanity, occupied the lowest position in the Lorayan
hierarchy, the position of Sweeper, clearly shown by the broad black
stripe across his face.

The space captain admitted that this was true.

Why then, Carver thundered, was this Lorayan Superior not able, in
spite of his so-called abilities, to reach any higher position in the
debased society in which he dwelt?

The question silenced the space captain and his supporters, demolished
the entire school, as a matter of fact. And the Carverian Doctrine of
the Implicit Inferiority of Non-Terrans is now accepted by reasoning
Terrans everywhere in the Galaxy.
