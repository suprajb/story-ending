High above them a United States destroyer was cutting through the ocean
swells, part of a great convoy that spread over many miles of water.
In the center of the convoy were the troop ships, surrounded by a
screen of other destroyers.

On the bridge the captain and his executive officer were chatting
desultorily. Their eyes scanned the waters constantly while they
talked, a sea-borne custom that long antedated the ship's bristling
radar screens. "If we put in anywhere along the Solomons," the captain
said, "I'll bet we'll see the natives still wearing and using the old
equipment--from forty-five."

"Yeah," grinned the exec. "They all say it was the Navy that ruined the
Pacific."

"Huh," snorted the other. "We went ashore--but the Army stayed ashore.
Whatever you find will be Government Issue."

The exec yawned. "Cripes, what a boring tour. I'd give my last bottle
for just one sight of a good old Nip periscope."

"Or a Kamikaze," growled the captain sarcastically.

A radioman stepped out on the bridge, saluted, and handed the captain a
flimsy. He read it, and frowned at the exec.

"Lead ship says we're about to pass over a submerged object--a derelict
of some sort. The chief says to blast it. Menace to navigation and so
forth."

The exec stepped to the squawk-box, and flicked the switch. "Attention.
Attention. Y-gun crew report to stations--on the double. Y-gun--on
deck."

As he stood there, waiting for the CPO commanding that detail to
acknowledge and request orders, he let out a yawn, a prodigious
mid-afternoon yawn that threatened to split his head.
