I listened to all this in silence. "But," I said when she had finished,
"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine
laborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?"

Grannie Annie frowned. "I'm not sure I can answer the first of those
questions," she replied. "You must remember Antlers Park has been on
this moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted
himself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just
what to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.

"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's
diabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens
buttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master
controlling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners
were in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would
be susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you
coming with me?"

"Coming with you?" I repeated. "Where?"

The old lady lit a cigarette. "Pluto maybe," she said. "There's a penal
colony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new
crime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,
fugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes...."

"Grannie," I laughed. "You're incorrigible!"
