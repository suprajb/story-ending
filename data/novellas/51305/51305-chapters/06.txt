Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and
thought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the
girl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that
_was_ my name.

"Kevin," I told her. "John Kevin."

"Mister Kevin," she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like
waterhose mist on a summer afternoon, "I wonder if you could help _me_."

"Happy to, miss," I mumbled.

She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.
"What do you think of this?"

I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.

    Dear Acolyte R. I. S.:

    Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, "The
    Scarlet Book" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the
    Universe

    Name: ........................

    Address: .....................

The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner
and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.

There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was
trying to pull it out.

I looked up at his stubbled face. "I had half a dozen hamburgers, a
cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and
a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five--if the
lady didn't pay you."

"She didn't," he stammered. "Why do you think I was trying to get that
bill out of your hand?"

I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman
put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant
bar, smoothing it.

I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the
sidewalk, only in the doorways.
