She was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back,
drawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing
mouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing
a powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the
upper half of her legs.

The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it
wasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that.
It was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.

I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody
would help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they
think you are blotto.

"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?" I kept my eyes down.
I couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. "Just a dime for a
cup of coffee." I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two
and a half.

I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used,
perhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. "Do you want
it for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?"

I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized
that anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate
tourists.

"Just coffee, ma'am." She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to
call her that. "A little more for food, if you could spare it."

I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.

"I'll buy you a dinner," she said carefully, "provided I can go with
you and see for myself that you actually eat it."

I felt my face flushing red. "You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum
like me, ma'am."

"I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat."

It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice
whatever.

"Okay," I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.
