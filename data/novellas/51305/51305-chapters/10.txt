She inclined the lethal silver toy. "Let me see those papers, Kevin."

I handed her the doctor's manuscript.

Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. "It's all right. It's all right.
It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read
this myself."

Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.

"Don't move, Kevin," she said. "I'll have to shoot you--maybe not to
kill, but painfully."

I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I
had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there
was something else.

"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair," I
told her.

She shook her head. "I don't know what you think it does to you."

It was getting hard for me to think. "Who are you?"

She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable,
North American Mounted Police.

I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. "What do you want?"

"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found
a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical,
topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it
secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist--he had
his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?"

I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew
was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.

"It takes money--money Doc didn't have--to make money," Miss Casey
said, "even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will
prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of
Doc's character. He was a scholar."

Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared
me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I
needed some coffee.

"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines
for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right--until
he started obtaining books that _did not exist_."
