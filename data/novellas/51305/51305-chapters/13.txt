Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.

I knew I could not let Doc's--Dad's--time travel _thing_ fall into
anyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had
disappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.

Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I
don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.

I kicked the _thing_ to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you
can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums
before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time
travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we
weren't now.

Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't
mind her touching me.

"I'm glad," she said.

Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?

I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed _it_ because I didn't
want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose,
direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could
kick the habit--perhaps with Miss Casey's help--but I wasn't really
confident.

Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material
needs would not grow and roast coffee.
