First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon
light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window
somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and
the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had
changed around--prayer came from the left, song from the right.

Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a _thing_.

My heart hammered at my lungs. I _knew_ this last time had been
different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time
Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a
start.

He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom.
His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed "springs"--metal
webbing--and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had
dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a
meaningful whole.

I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I
became lost.

I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of
hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any
hungry rats out of the walls.

I knelt beside Doc.

"An order, my boy, an order," he whispered.

I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?

He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen,
before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook
against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.

"Concentrate," Doc said hoarsely. "Concentrate...."

I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of
concentration.

The words "First Edition" were what I was thinking about most.
