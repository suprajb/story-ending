The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet
high. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino
singing on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't
have any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.

I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face
to shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the
bedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.

Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning
eyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so
dirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy
scalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's
gas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed
to shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I
didn't need to.

The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered,
uncovered floor.

It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a
jagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it
an unreal distortion.

Doc began to mumble louder.

I knew I had to move.

I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I
moved.

I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found
my notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both
my mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I
concentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their
habit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were
suddenly distinguishable.

"_Outsider_ ... _Thoth_ ... _Dyzan_ ... _Seven_ ... _Hsan_ ...
_Beyond Six, Seven, Eight_ ... _Two boxes_ ... _Ralston_ ... _Richard
Wentworth_ ... _Jimmy Christopher_ ... _Kent Allard_ ... _Ayem_ ...
_Oh, are_ ... _see_...."
