Phillipe Sansome made himself eminently useful. He assisted in surgery
every morning, refusing fees and pleading with everyone to maintain
his anonymity. The staff was in on the conspiracy, and the nurses
smiled indulgently at him behind his back. But Sansome was too great a
man to ridicule. The general feeling was the same as mine. He was
older than he thought, not in body, but in over-tired nerves and
exhausted mind. None contested his skill with the scalpel; but none
gave ten cents worth of credence to his twist on the theory of
evolution.

As Sara's confinement proceeded with precise conformity to my
expectations, I thought Sansome would lose heart--but he didn't. He
arranged to be present in the delivery room with as much interest as
if we expected a breach birth of a two-headed panda.

I was unfortunately called to Baltimore at the last minute. I flew
both ways, but my haste was in vain. Sara gave birth while I was still
aloft.

I checked in with more excitement than I'd thought possible. I asked
at the desk, "How's Caffey?"

"Fine. Gave birth an hour ago. Beautiful little girl--"

I didn't wait for more. I dashed upstairs to the maternity ward, where
Sara had finally consented to be moved, and slipped into her room.

She was tired, but conscious. She smiled at me peculiarly.

"So it's a girl!" I exclaimed. "Wait until I see Sansome. A beautiful,
healthy, normal baby!"

A hand tapped me softly on the shoulder, and I turned to look into
Sansome's triumphant eyes.

"Without a navel," he said.
