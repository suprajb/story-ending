Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.
Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow
of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.

"Can't see a thing," he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away
at the computer's table. "Look--are those lights over there?"

The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. "Probably the guards. Of
course, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party."

Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no
answer in his stolid face. "Don't joke about it," he said. "Suppose
something happens to the delegation?"

"Then we're in the soup," the Exec said philosophically. "I told you
the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for the
last three hundred years."

"It isn't all the natives," Lowry said. "Look how they've doubled the
guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they
know how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this
secret group they call the Council."

"And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?" the
Exec retorted. "They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone
out now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be
coming from the town, anyhow...."
