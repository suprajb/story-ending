"Cressey, can you hear me?"

"Yes, I can hear you. Who is it?"

"It's Captain Mackley. I've come to see you."

"Well--thanks, Captain."

"You got the Outspacer, Cressey. I thought you'd like to know."

"Frankly, Captain, I couldn't care less. But thanks for telling me,
anyway."

"It means a lot, Cressey. There were a lot of people's lives riding
with you."

_Yeah, I'm a hero. I'm a Hornetman._

"Thanks, Captain."

"Was it pretty rough?"

_Rough? Like birth and death and all of life, rolled into minutes._

"No more so than I expected, Captain. Pretty much routine. Routine for
a Hornetman."
