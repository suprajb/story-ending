Most of the diners had gone back into the hotel. They had stood for
an indecisive moment, looking this way and that. Baffled by the
disappearance of the alien beings, they had straggled inside one by
one. Few words were spoken among them, since each was mentally busy
forming a theory to explain the occurrence.

Two of those who dallied behind, both youths, had already come up
with explanations, and were telling them to each other with great
zealousness and many a gesture.

"Listen," said Bicks. "I tell you they used invisibility belts.
Something got out of whack with them just when those beings entered
the dining hall and we saw them. They high-tailed it, working on the
belts as they ran. By the time they reached the street, they had them
repaired. Zap!--just like that, they were invisible again and we lost
them. It's simple."

"It's too simple," said Paul scornfully. "Why would both belts conk out
at once? My idea is that they came out of another dimension. Looking
Earth over for conquest, maybe. But when they found themselves in
the hotel surrounded by a lot of people--we'd be monsters to them,
you know--they got panicky and ran. Then they recovered, switched on
whatever gadget they use, and returned to their own dimension. I'd bet
my life that's the real answer."

Bicks didn't agree. He ridiculed the theory, improvised a joke about
it. His companion answered hotly. Immersed in argument they walked
slowly up the hotel steps.

Both glanced briefly at the large banner stretched above the door. The
banner which read:

                       WELCOME TO THE CHICON II!
