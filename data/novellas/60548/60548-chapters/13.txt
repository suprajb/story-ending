The meeting was over, and the fateful decision had been made. For the
next great tide much of my work would consist in reporting the tearing
down of the Big Run.

The alien had believed it to be one of our cities. It was a great deal
of work, constructing the Big Run to test one alien specimen, but the
results had proven the effort warranted. Now it could be disposed of.

Perhaps this very day we would begin dismantling the giant testing maze.
