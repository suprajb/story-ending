For seventeen days they examined the alien. As expected, they learned
quickly that his body was intrinsically weak. His vital organs had no
protective walls of cartilage, and he was extremely vulnerable to the
thrust of any sharp or pointed weapon.

Our first opinion was that he would prove an innocuous foe. However,
as the tests continued, we began to have some doubts. Physically he was
quite powerful. His reflexes were sharp, and he showed an aptness at
learning that surprised us. And his intelligence was above average.

The twentieth day I was ordered to report to Srtes' office. I found the
other seven members of the council already conferring with Srtes when I
entered.

"We have been unable to arrive at any definite conclusion thus far,"
Srtes was saying. "Therefore it becomes necessary to try him in the
Big Run." He paused and frowned in annoyance as I made some slight
disturbance. Hurriedly I took my place. I moved among these men only by
sufferance.

"One of the crewmen on the space ship that brought him here," Srtes
resumed, "a Zade named Ctvar, clashed with the alien several times
during the voyage. He was restrained from violence by the captain. This
Ctvar should prove an apt instrument for driving our hostage to the
proper desperation for the Big Run."

Srtes switched on the large visi-screen that blanketed the front wall
of his office. "The alien has been wandering through the streets for
the past several hours," he said. "If we are fortunate, Ctvar should
put in his appearance soon."
