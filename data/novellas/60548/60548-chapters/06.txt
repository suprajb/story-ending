The next step would be mine. During the rest of the afternoon, as I
watched on the visi-screen, the Earthling kept to his room. Most of the
day he lay on his sleeping rug, with his eyes wide open, staring at the
ceiling. The rest of the time he paced aimlessly. The next morning he
ate the last of his porridge, and as the day progressed I recognized
that much of his unrest must be prompted by hunger. Yet his battered
body needed the rest he was giving it.

He napped shortly after dusk, but only for a short time. When he awoke
he put on his jacket and went outside. On the screen I followed his
forlorn wanderings about the city.

After several hours he stopped and leaned against a wooden building.
The night breeze had risen to its near-gale intensity by this time, and
he pulled his jacket closer about him. It was only a few degrees below
freezing, and he should have been warm enough, but I understood his
race was unable to withstand any great degree of cold. And he was sore
and hungry.

I received my call from Srtes then. He and the council had decided that
the alien had reached the proper depth of misery and hopelessness. I
was to contact him--and set him for the Big Run.
