They were locking the thorax section on the Ambassador. He stood
straight and silent. Very straight.

"Ambassador," the old man pleaded over thirty million miles, "you
don't _know_ what you're going to meet on Venus. You don't _know_
that they're particularly smart. And they don't know about you. Maybe
they're a little afraid of you. Maybe they're a _lot_ afraid of you. We
don't know one way. But we don't know the other.

"But you know now, the best way and the best minute I can tell you,
that some pretty dumb creatures live beyond Earth. Now, the way my
grandfather's grandfather used to say, you wouldn't start selling your
horse to a stranger by telling him that your horse is no good?"

Silence, then, on the beam from Earth to Venus.

The dressers began to lower the helmet over the Ambassador's head. He
stopped them. "Wait a minute."

Still that nakedness in his mind, and the fear ready to pounce again.
But that was only an effect of space, not Venusians. Or was it simply
Lampell's heritage. A conditioning?

And that contemptuous message, with its almost-impossible time limit
and its pointed refusal to allow him to set foot upon Venus and its
"representative of the fifth authority." He didn't know one way and
he didn't know the other, but it could be a defense mechanism on the
Venusians' part.

In Center Room an old, old man had slumped in his chair, exhausted,
reduced to crippled flesh that bore one bright, brave Earthman's eye.
The Ambassador waved. The old-timer waved back eagerly.

"Gentlemen," said the Ambassador formally, but he spoke to the one
adventurer, "I thought I was in a hurry but I've decided I've plenty of
time. I think it will be a very good idea to open these negotiations by
keeping the other party waiting."
