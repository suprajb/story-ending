The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
when they do their magic dances.

They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.
