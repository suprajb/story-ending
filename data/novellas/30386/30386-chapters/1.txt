"You're awake."

A brilliant statement, that--because I had sat up, squinted into the
bright sunlight streaming in through the doorway, yawned and stretched.
The Onists, I tell you, lack imagination.

The girl who spoke was a pretty enough little thing for an Onist. She
smiled, showing even white teeth. "Do you Pluralists eat?"

I nodded and rubbed my belly. I was to have had dinner after my turn as
sentry the night before, and now I felt like I could do justice to my
portion even at one of the orgies for which the Onists are so famous.

"Bring on your food and I'll show you," I told her, and she turned her
back to walk outside. It was early and the village seemed silent--surely
they hadn't intended this one slim maid to guard me! Yet she seemed
alone.

I leaped at her, circled her neck with my arm, prepared to make my exit.
They would laugh around our fire when I told them of this fine example
of the Onist lack of foresight....

Except that the girl yelped. Not loudly, but it was loud enough, and a
big muscular Onist came striding in with his throwing spear. He backed
me off into a corner, prodding my hungry belly with his weapon.

"Will you behave?"
