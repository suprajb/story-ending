_Click!_ went the receiver, and from a slide, Channing removed the
judge's watch. With a flourish, he started it, and handed it to the
judge, who glared.

"Now," added Tinkin, "I wish to add--

_Click!_

"--two objects may be similar in form--

_Click!_

"--but can not be identities!

_Click!_

"However, two communications--

_Click!_

"--may be dissimilar in form--

_Click!_

"--but identical in meaning!

_Click!_

"We have before us--

_Click!_

"--a condition where--

_Click!_

"--identical messages are--

_Click!_

"--being reproduced in identical form--

_Click!_

"--just like a bunch of--

_Click!_

"--carbon copies!"

_Click!_

"The production rate of which--

_Click!_

"--will be high enough--

_Click!_

"--to lower the cost--

_Click!_

"--of this previously rare item--

_Click!_

"--until it is well within the reach of all."

_Click!_

"Just as in communications--

_Click!_

"--we may send an order--

_Click!_

"--directing the fabrication--

_Click!_

"--of several hundred similar items!

_Click!_

"And our supplier will bill us--

_Click!_

"--for them later!"

_Brrr-rup!_

"That last buzz or burp was a signal that we have reached the end of
our matter bank. Our credit, for example, has run out. However, Dr.
Channing is about to make a substantial deposit with the manufacturer,
and we will resume operations later. I ask you--

_Click!_

"--can you do this with energy?"

_Click!_

"Stop that infernal--

_Click!_

"--machine before I have you all held for disrespect, perjury, contempt
of court, and grand larceny!" yelled the judge.

Channing stopped the machine and started to hand out the carbon-copy
watches to the audience, who received them with much glee. Kingman came
to life at this point. He rose from his chair and started to object,
but he was stopped by Tinkin who leaned over and whispered:

"My worthy and no doubt learned opponent, I'd advise that you keep your
magnificent oratory buttoned tight in those flapping front teeth of
yours. If we all get into that gadget--how would you like to fight ten
or twelve of us?"


                               THE END.
