"Over there is my ship," Joseph said, pointing. "We are making ready to
put out for Arcturus."

There was a bright constancy about Joseph that clutched at the heart.
Not Lieutenant Wellesley's heart, of course, he reminded himself.
The "ship" was indeed the rusty, peaked foretank from some ancient
freighter, complete with hatch. It was set on end at the edge of the
swamp. To any boy it would have been a starship.

It was already dusk. The Ophirian daub-hut was not so bad as he
expected. It was massive. The orifice had been enlarged into a door.
Windows had been added. The only furnishing was the rude couch. It was
a measure of Sealilly's hostility.

Joseph spied the ferrax-thing scuttling across the lawn and dived at
it. The two of them rolled over and over, Joseph laughing, the animal
growling and spitting.

Wellesley went in, closed the door and removed his official log
from its case. The next two hours were spent in a carefully worded
account--for space logs are part of the permanent records of the
Galactic Court, among others--of the events of the day, including a
bleak and perhaps prejudiced account of the character of Aidennsport
and of Amos Sealilly.

Afterwards he lay back on the couch and smoked several cigarettes
in lieu of the food capsules that he did not crave. He was far from
imaginative; nevertheless, the character of the place crept at last
into his consciousness. He was used to cramped, machinery-filled
spaces and the sterile smells of hot metal and ozone; here was an
aura of decaying organic matter--and of something else. A faint,
but unmistakable reptilian odor, attesting to the nature of past
inhabitants.

The vault of darkness was absolute, unabated by the dim patches of
light that were the fenestrations above where he lay.

And presently someone very stealthily opened the door and entered.
