There was a rustling sound like dry leaves in the wind, and a sudden,
sharp pain in his temple. Then another at the base of his neck. He fell
back and sprang out into the open. The aperture, in an instant, was
full of small, needle-like fluttering things.

"Stingbats!" Joseph screamed. "Run!"

Wellesley fled after him, but he was already beginning to feel a sick,
draining weakness. Within a few steps his legs had become rubbery.
Joseph was out of sight. Perhaps gone for help. But then Joseph did not

off the trail. He sank down, there, beneath a fern tree, cursing.

He was sure that he was dying, for a numbness, an absence of feeling,
had stolen up from his feet and possessed his legs. He essayed a bitter
smile. He was more chagrined than afraid, for this was an ignominious
way to pass, here in a nameless swamp, alone, not even beset by one
worthy enemy. And perhaps when he thought he smiled, he was merely
baring his teeth in that manner that certain neurotoxins leave their
corpses always....
