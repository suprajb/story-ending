_One week out_:

Oliver Brunei stepped into the common room. Lin Pey, Vera, and Lazar
were sitting together, on what appeared to be a huge purple toadstool.

But that's _my_ hallucination, thought Brunei. _At least, I think it
is._

"Hello Ollie," said Lazar.

"Hi. What're you doing?"

"We're looking at the dragon again," said Vera. "Join us?"

Brunei thought of the dragon for a moment. The toadstool disappeared,
and the by-now-familiar bovine dragon took its place. In the last few
days, they had discovered that if any two of them concentrated on
something long enough to "materialize" it, anyone else who wanted to
could see it in a moment.

"What's so interesting about that silly dragon?" said Brunei.

"How about the camel?" said Lazar.

The dragon turned into the two-humped brown camel.

"Phooey!" said Lin Pey.

"O.K.," said Vera, "so what do you want?"

Lin Pey thought for a moment.

"How about a meadow?" he said. "A soft lawn of green grass, the sky is
blue, and there are a few white clouds...."

"Clover is blooming," said Lazar. "Smell it."

Brunei reclined on the soft green grass. The smell of the earth
beneath him was warm and moist. "A few apple trees here and there," he
said, and there was shade.

"Look over the hill!" said Lazar. "There's the dragon!"

"Will you _please_ get rid of that dragon?" snapped Brunei.

"O.K., Ollie, O.K."
