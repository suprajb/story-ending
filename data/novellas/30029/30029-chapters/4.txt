The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin
was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse
anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,
the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and
the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around
were so much primer material for the Tr'en. "They can be treated
mathematically," one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told
Korvin thinly. "Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.
But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be
confused by such means."

"Good," Korvin said.

The experts blinked. "Good?" he said.

"Naturally," Korvin said in a friendly tone.

The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his
best not to react. "Your plan is a failure," the expert said, "and you
call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different
from the one we are occupied with."

"True," Korvin said.

There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the
indicators of the lie-detector with great care. "What is your plan?"
he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.

"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically," Korvin said.

The silence this time was even longer.

"The machine says that you tell the truth," the experts said at last,
in a awed tone. "Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.
You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly
to aid us."

Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the
only logical deduction.

But it happened to be wrong.
