Murdock remembered how proud his parents had been when he was finally
accepted for Space Training--the only boy in Thayerville to be chosen.
But then, it was only right that he should have been the one. The other
boys, those who failed, had not _lived_ the dream as he had lived it.
From the moment he'd watched the first moon rocket land he had known,
beyond any possible doubt, that he would become a rocketman. He had
stood there, in that cold December of 1980, a boy of 12, watching the
great rocket fire down from space, watching it thaw and blacken the
frozen earth. He had known that he would one day follow it back to the
stars, to vast and alien horizons, to worlds past imagining.

He remembered his last night on Earth, twenty long years ago, when
he had felt the pressing immensity of the vast and terrible universe
surrounding him as he lay in his bed. He remembered the sleepless hours
before dawn, when he could feel the tension building within the single
room, within himself lying there in the heated stillness of the small,
white house. He remembered the rain, near morning, drumming the roof,
and the thunder roaring powerfully across the Kansas sky. And then,
somehow, the thunder's roar blended into the deep atomic roar of a
rocket, carrying him away from Earth, away to the burning stars ...
away ...

_Away._
