His companion sighed and shook his head. "I _still_ don't think it's
right somehow. It just doesn't seem right to me."

"It's what they wanted, isn't it?" asked the other. "It's what they
wrote in their wills. They vowed their son would never come home to
death. In another month he'll be gone anyway. Back for another twenty
years. Why ruin it all for him?" The man paused, shading his eyes
against the sun. "And they _are_ perfect, aren't they? He'll never
know."

"I suppose you're right," nodded the second man. "He'll never know."

And he watched the old man and the old woman and the tall son until
they were out of sight.
