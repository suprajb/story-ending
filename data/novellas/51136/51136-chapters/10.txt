Chuck Mead came through the harrowing experience of crossing worlds
and stood once more on the top of Hobson's Hill in his own world. He
glanced all around him, nervously reassuring himself that he _was_ in
his own world again. Then he took a crumpled cigarette from his shirt
pocket and inhaled hungrily while he waited for his heart to stop its
frantic hammering.

Had he really been in another world, he wondered, and had he really
seen Estelle? Presently, as he recalled events, his train of thought
brought him around to Kathy and his decision. She would still be mad at
him after the fight they had had when Charles arrived. Funny, now he
couldn't even remember what they had been quarreling about! It seemed
that any little thing could start them off these days.

But it wasn't too late--he was sure of that now. The situation could
still be repaired. There was still time.

With a quick, determined gesture, he flung the cigarette away from him,
and with a new spring in his stride, he set off down the hill.
