Somewhere in the infinite universe, among the myriad worlds and
possibilities, was a world born of a decision. In this world, Charles
Mead stood on top of Hobson's Hill dismantling his apparatus. He was
finished with it and was going to destroy it as soon as he got home.
Chuck had been right; he was a fool to think of leaving Estelle for a
mad dream.

Strange, he thought, the way he had neglected her all these years.
A girl like Estelle needed warmth and gayety and affection, not the
boorish neglect of an idiot who wished he was in another world. He was
lucky, he realized, that she was still there to go home to.

With the act of making his decision, he felt a new peace of mind he had
not experienced in years. At least he was about to tackle a problem
within his grasp, not some ridiculous and impossible hunt through an
infinity of alien worlds.

He shook his head, genuinely puzzled. How on Earth could he have ever
considered such an absurd notion, he wondered as he shouldered his
equipment and set off down the hill.
