In yet another world, also born of a decision, Charles and Chuck Mead
emerged on top of Hobson's Hill. They looked about them eagerly,
pointing out the landmarks in the town below.

"This one's _really_ different!" Charles said excitedly. "Look, there's
no lumberyard and not even any railroad tracks. And that tall gray
building downtown is new, too!"

"Let's go," Chuck urged. "Let's take a look."

"Take it easy," Charles cautioned, his hand on Chuck's arm. "We'll have
to be careful about this. Remember, we're looking for the best--the
perfect--world!"

"Okay," Chuck said. "Even if it takes a lifetime, we settle for nothing
but the best."

And together, like two wise men off to seek Truth itself and, at the
same time, like two schoolboys on some youthful adventure, they set off
down the hill.
