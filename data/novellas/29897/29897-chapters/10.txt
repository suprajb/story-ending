It hadn't happened that way, of course. But if it _had_ happened--well,
it might have on just such a tub as this.

A guard saw him peering through the fence, and said, "What are you

"Those ships," said Plato, honestly enough. And then he added, to throw
the man off the track, "Gee, I'd be scared to go up in one of them. No,

The man laughed. "They're not for the likes of you. A lot of those ships

you. Now run along and mind your own business."

Plato was happy to run along. Unfortunately, he realized, running along
didn't help him to get past the fence.

And then he had a fear-inspiring thought. He couldn't tell an
interplanetary ship from an interstellar. What if he did manage,
