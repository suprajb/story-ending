When the Morid came, Ellis was sitting dumbly on the sand, nursing his
broken ankle and considering with a shock-detached part of his mind a
fragmentary line of some long-forgotten schooldays poem.

_What rough beast is this_ ... the rest eluded him.

The underbrush beyond the shack rustled and the Morid’s ravening image
sprang to Ellis’ mind with a clarity that shook his three
net-participants to the core—one of them past endurance.

Vann, in the station, said “_Dear God_,” and braced himself for the end.
In Washington, the operator fainted and had to be dragged from his
console.

Aboard the Federation ship, Xaxtol radiated a shaken “Enough!” and
tentacled a stud that sent his craft flashing on its way through
subspace.

At Charlie Trask’s shack, Max bounded across the clearing and into the
brush. There followed a riot of squalling and screaming that brought
Charlie out of his shack on the run. Ellis sat numbly, beyond shock,
waiting for the worst.

Unaccountably, the worst was delayed.

Charlie came back, clutching a protesting Max by the scruff of the neck,
and threw down something at Ellis’ feet. Something small and limp and
magenta-furred, smeared with greenish blood and very, very dead.

“There’s your varmint,” said Charlie.

With one minute remaining before the promised bombers roared over,
Ellis, with a frozen clarity he had not dreamed he possessed, radiated a
final message before he fainted again.

“Call off the jets,” he said, in effect. “It’s over. The beast is dead.
The hermit’s cat killed it.”
