The Morid’s escape left Xaxtol, Federation ship’s commander, in a
dilemma bordering upon the insoluble.

It would have been bad enough to lose so rare a specimen even on a
barren world, but to have one so voracious at large upon one so
teeming—as the primitive Telethink signals demonstrated—with previously
unsuspected intelligence was unthinkable.

This, at the outset, was Xaxtol’s problem:

Forbidden by strictest Galactic injunction, he could not make planetfall
and interfere with a previously unscouted primitive culture.
Contrariwise, neither could civilized ethic condone his abandoning such
an unsuspecting culture to the bloody mercies of a Morid without every
effort to correct his blunder.

Hanging in stationary orbit in order to keep a fixed relation to the
Morid’s landing site, the Federation commander debated earnestly with
his staff until a sudden quickening of the barbarous Telethink net made
action imperative.

Two of the autochthons were isolated on a small island with the Morid.
Unwarned, they were doomed.

So he grouped his staff about him—sitting, crouching, coiling or
hovering, as individual necessity demanded—and as one entity put the
whole into rapport with the all-but-meaningless signals that funneled up
from the Telethink station in the Florida Keys.

And, in doing so, roused a consternation as great as his own and
infinitely more immediate.
