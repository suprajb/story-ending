Which sage--if time-worn--observation was the last comment our insanely
sensible First Officer would offer on the case of Major Gilchrist _vs._
The-Rest-of-Us. And since the efficiency expert withdrew into his shell
and stayed there for the rest of the trip, nothing more happened to
disturb the peace and tranquillity of ye goode shippe _Saturn_ that
voyage.

So Biggs is back! A slightly older, slightly wiser, definitely more
conventional Biggs, now that he's a married man with responsibilities.
And after all the messes his crack-pot ideas have got us into in the
past, I guess we all ought to be glad he _has_ settled down.

But--I don't know. Married or not, Biggs is Biggs. And wherever his
gangling frame intrudes itself, things have a way of happening. For
instance, next month the _Saturn_ is taking off for Uranus on a simple,
ordinary cargo trip. On the face of it, it looks like smooth sailing.
But Biggs is back on the bridge. And--

Well--anybody want to make any bets?
