At two o'clock, the baby set up a hungry howl, and Dan Bryan stirred
and sat up in bed.

"Wake up," he said to his wife.

"What is it?"

"That damn thing is sure screaming its head off. I don't think I can
wait. I think we ought to take care of it now."

"But how can we?" his wife said. "It would look suspicious, wouldn't
it?"

"What if it does? We can move out of here tomorrow, see another part of
the world."

"But Lotha warned us to be careful--"

"Lotha!" Dan Bryan said, his lips curled. "Why should we listen to
anything _he_ says? We take our orders directly from Jeheera, not from
a dirty Nahrlan traitor. I say tonight."

"Whatever you say, dear," his wife answered.

Mr. Gertz looked at the bedside clock, moaned, and punched his pillow
angrily.

"That lousy brat!" he said. "Why doesn't somebody shut him up?"

His request was answered. With abrupt suddenness, the baby's pitiful
cry ended.

"There," Mrs. Gertz said comfortably. "I told you, Louie. The poor
thing was only hungry. Now go to sleep."

Mr. Gertz rolled over. He dozed off quickly, now that the night was
still, and slept with the innocence of a babe.
