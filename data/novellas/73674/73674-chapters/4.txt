"And this is your recommendation?"

"Yes, sir. There are drawbacks, of course. The Baby is a helpless thing
at first, dependent upon human care. But it is this very helplessness
which makes the Baby so acceptable to the Earth-race. Our agent would
have to suffer a period of helplessness before he is able to perform
his scouting duties, but the few lost years will be well worth the
outcome. He will be completely accepted into Earth-society. He will be
one of them--not an alien stranger, unused to their ways and customs
and mores. He will grow up as a normal member of the Earth-race. Then,
when the proper moment comes, he will be in the best of positions to
blueprint our new battlefield, in astonishing detail."

From the corner of the room, Lotha, the ex-chairman of the Nahrla War
Council, twisted his features bitterly and said:

"And just how does Shura propose to introduce this agent to the planet?
Can we place him in the very womb of some Earth-creature?"

"No," Shura said. "That cannot be done. But infiltrating an agent
in the form of a human Baby will be no problem. The Earth-creatures
readily accept Babies, without question as to parentage or identity.
There are thousands of such Babies born every day on the planet, and
special institutions have been created for their care."

Lotha growled. "It's ridiculous. Too elaborate. I prefer the direct
approach."

"That is our recommendation," Shura said stiffly. "I suggest we put it
up to a council vote."

The chairman nodded in assent.

"Shura is right. The Council will vote on the proposal. All those in
favor, will please raise their fourth hand."
