RADIO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEER DEAD

Howard E. Edwards, Suicide

_Philadelphia, Feb. 18._ The body of Howard E. Edwards, B.S., PhD.,
Member I. R. E., eminent authority on Radio Communications, aged 56, was
found this morning in the back yard of his residence, 1427 Raines
Avenue. The body was almost completely buried in a long narrow hole in
the ground.

At first, foul-play was suspected, but later it appeared that Edwards
had dug himself into the ground and died of suffocation, as his nostrils
and mouth were filled with dirt.

Dr. P. A. Hofner, who examined the body, found no wounds, stated that
Edwards had been dead for about two days, and pronounced the death as a
clear case of suicide, the strange means employed probably due to an
unbalanced mental condition.

Elaborate radio apparatus upon which Edwards had been working had been
smashed to bits.
