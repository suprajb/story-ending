_Feb. 11_

Mrs. Winslow, the middle-aged widow, who comes to clean my house and
laboratory twice a week, was here this morning.

She is short, dumpy, and inclined to be stout. As she went about her
work, I noticed particularly the fat firm flesh of her neck, just below
the jaw. I felt an uncontrollable desire to sink my teeth deep into that
flesh, and enjoy the taste of the warm fresh blood.

I had actually risen from my chair to accomplish my desire, when the
telephone rang ... and my mind cleared.
