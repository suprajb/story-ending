_Jan. 25._

Last night, in my dreams, I was a monstrous ant, and had been digging
myself a burrow in the soft fresh earth. The dream was intensely real,
and when I awoke, I felt as tired as if I had actually been digging. My
arms ached, and I was astonished, upon examining my hands, to find them
raw.

Dressing hastily, I rushed to the back yard, and there, sure enough,
near the fence, was a large hole about two feet deep and three feet
long. Hurriedly, I filled it in and returned to the house.

I must rest for a few days, as I feel that the intense excitement caused
by my investigations, is preying too heavily upon my mind.

At this time, I feel that I should make a brief summary of my findings
in respect to the ants, so that Barclay may go over these notes upon his
return from his vacation.

_First:_ The ant colony is the source of a powerful bell-like tone which
is radiated continuously on two wave-lengths, .0018 meter, and .00176
meter. This tone acts as a radio-beacon, and directs the ants to the
colony, no matter where they may be located. The .0018 meter wave is
used by the ants for their "clacking" conversations, by means of which
they communicate with each other and the colony, receiving orders from
the directing intelligence, reporting the location of food, and
requesting help, when needed.

The wave .00176 meter, is used for sending thought images or pictures
which may be sent with the "clacking" code, or independently. I cannot
conceive a more efficient or highly specialized communications system. I
_must_ learn their secret, their methods.
