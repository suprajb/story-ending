Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and--she
knew--youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.
How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She
would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the
stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again--it was just from
lying in the sling so long.

She made her voice light and gay. "Are we not going very, very fast,
now, Robert?"

He answered without turning. "Yes. Many times the speed of light."

"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it
too?"

He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. "How long have we been
going, Robert?"

He said, "I don't know ... depends on where you are."

"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I
am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good
appetites, don't they, Robert?"

He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it
ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. _It's the excitement_, she
told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the
years to be young again....
