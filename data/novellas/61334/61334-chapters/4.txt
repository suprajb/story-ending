The following afternoon, as Five-gun Charles DeCrabbe made his farewell
of the city of Featherton, he once more drove down the center of the
street with the bubble of his space convertible slid back.

Yet there was a difference this time. The mayor and his son rode beside
him on the seat, and all of the people were now out of doors standing
along the curb, cheering their deliverer wildly as he passed.

"I can't tell you how much I personally appreciate what you've done for
us," said the mayor humbly.

"Quite quite quite!" returned Five-gun haughtily in his clipped speech,
hoping to shut off the man's tendency toward windyness.

With awe in his voice the mayor's son admired, "So instead of being
scared to death you were all ready for action when you and the
whirlybird landed at their rocky, mountain lair?"

"Yes yes yes! Slid off its back, hid between two boulders, waited
for the appropriate moment. After bagging that one, waited for other
monsters as they landed, one by one. Bagged them."

"Just like that!" said the youngster. "You just get up close enough for
those peoplehawks to grab you and then you bagged them."

"Only possible way is my way," clipped DeCrabbe immovably.

"Its eyes couldn't be buried deeply in feathers if they were to be of
use."

"So?"

"So eye is proximate to beak--and brain," said the hunter with dignity.
"Where one of its _coo-coos_ came out, one of my N-ray bolts went in,
and that was that!"
