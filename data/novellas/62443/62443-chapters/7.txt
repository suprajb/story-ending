And on the ship speeding back to the spacelanes, Bart Caxton clawed at
his shirt collar. He gasped, trying to get oxygen from the dying air.
He read the gauges with incredulous eyes, then came to his feet and
lurched down the corridor. He swung through the door of the tank room,
swayed there, his eyes straining into the semi-darkness.

And a terrible scream ripped at his constricted throat. For he knew
then the thing that Headley would shortly discover. The pools of
semi-frozen liquid on Uranus were of liquid oxygen--and the animals in
those pools lived on pure oxygen.

Even as he watched, one animal turned from the last tank of oxygen, ran
frantically about on short legs, then collapsed, its split mouth gaping
in death.

Caxton screamed, felt nausea cramping at his body. He remembered then
the liquid into which he had rolled Headley's body, and he knew the
other man would live to see Earth again. And he knew then that the
animals in the ship had used in minutes the life-giving gas that should
have lasted for days.

And even as he screamed, he fell. And the last sight he had was of the
rock-animals' split mouths laughing at him and his plans in an awful
mocking silence.
