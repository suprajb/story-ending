And back on Uranus, Tom Headley stirred out of his unconsciousness.
He gasped, struggled to his feet. Metal banged on his shoulder, and a
reaching hand found the opened valve. He instinctively screwed it shut,
dull horror and terror piling in his mind.

He knew that he had but seconds to live, and the utter futility of his
predicament made the situation even more horrible. True, he had his
radio--but its range was less than a hundred miles; it would bring
rescue only if a rescue party landed. He laughed a bit, grimly,
ironically, remembering the great supply of food tablets that were in
his suit. All that he lacked to live was air.

Then he frowned, seeing the oxygen gauge in his suit. The needle
pressed tight against its stop-post. He tapped it, then checked another
gauge. And sudden understanding came to his eyes--and he fought against
the hysterical laughter that filled his throat.

Bart Caxton had failed in his murder attempt.

For Tom Headley's shoulder tank was full of liquid oxygen. He had
fallen into a pool of oxygen, liquesced by the tremendous pressure of
Uranus, and the pressure of the atmosphere had forced the oxygen into
his tank.

Now there were but the interminable weeks of waiting that were to come
before a rescue expedition was sent to save him.
