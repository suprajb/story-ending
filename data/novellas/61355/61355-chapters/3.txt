There were no seats. This was an older machine which they had not
bothered to replace, or even to correct. She stood in horror as the
long minutes passed.

Her number was finally called.

"I am here," she said as the machine hummed, and she gave her number.

"Your availability petition has been taken up," said the machine. "You
are however to receive twenty-eight demerits for disposing of 6300
credit after having been abandoned. Do you accept?"

"I accept," she said. She was so dizzy that she could hardly stand. The
machine whirred and produced a reception-area card. She read it, and
walked as in a daze to the indicated reception area. Yan waited for her
there.

"You look terrible," he said as he put his arm around her. "I'm sorry.
You made me do this to you. I didn't want to. It's all over now, don't
cry."

She thought that she was going to faint.

"Thank you for receiving me," she said, according to the formula. "I am
the Abandoned of Yan, of the Estate...."

"Stop it!" he said. "I know who you are! Stop it!"

"Do you have children at your estate?" She asked it as one asks a
polite, social question.

"They'll be there when we get home," he said. "Don't do this. I didn't
know it would hurt that much. I wouldn't have done it if I had. They're
your children again now." He held her shoulders as he looked at her.

"I came to you with twenty-eight demerits," she said. "Shall I work
them off before I come to your estate?"

"Please, stop it!" he said. "They were paid when you accepted. I waited
here all night. No one else could have claimed you. Please, come on
home now?" He handed her a brand-new wife-status card.

"Thank you," she said. "I shall try to deserve the opportunity which
you restore to me." He smiled as she recited the formula and took his
arm. Yet he did not look as if he felt like smiling.

"Come home," he said. "Come home now. I'll not hurt you again." He led
her back to their estate.

That night, feeling entirely justified, she abandoned him.
