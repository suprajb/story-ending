It was a sleek, streamlined jet job, the automobile of automobiles. Not
an antiquated monstrosity like the '51 coupe he'd been driving.

He stared through the window at its tear-drop lines, at its broad,
transparent top, at the shiny chrome and gold.

"We shouldn't be thinking about such things, Sandy. We should be
thinking about all those people, those poor people who died. All the
men and women and children--"

For an instant, grief welled up within him, a cold, almost sickening
grief. But abruptly, it became an impersonal, remote kind of grief.
It was like a Fourth of July rocket shooting out a blinding tail of
crimson and then bursting, its body crumbling into a thousand pieces, a
thousand tiny sparks falling and fading and dying.

"Still, they knew it was coming, didn't they, Sandy? And they didn't
try very hard to stop it."

He looked again at the car. "Reckon it won't do any harm to see how it
runs. After all, if we're goin' mad, we might as well enjoy ourselves
first."
