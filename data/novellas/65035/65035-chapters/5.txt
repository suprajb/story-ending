The window display in the sport shop fascinated him. There were guns
and fishing rods and fur-lined jackets and shiny boots and bright
woolen shirts and sun goggles and camp stoves and--

"Don't reckon the guns'd do us much good," Martin murmured, "seein' as
how there's nothing left alive--'cept us. Might be fun to shoot 'em
though. I remember when I was a kid, how I used to shoot windows out of
old houses." He chuckled softly.

His gaze traveled to the fishing equipment. "Golly, Sandy, I'll bet
there's fish left in the oceans! The gas never touched us there in the
cave. I'll bet the fish--or a lot of 'em--escaped, too!"

He glanced disapprovingly at his thin, faded shirt, dirty khaki
trousers, and worn, scuffed shoes. Those clean, bright, woolen clothes
in the window would be nice, very nice, on cool nights.

"Might even have dog clothes in there," he said. "Maybe a dog sweater.
How'd you like that, Sandy?"

Sandy barked eagerly.
