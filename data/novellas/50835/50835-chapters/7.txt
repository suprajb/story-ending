What luck, Reuben thought--what unbelievable luck to be at a fulcrum of
history like this!

He searched the level for Rudolph's apartment and gained admission.

To the general, he said: "Sir, I have to report that your friend May is
insane. He has just been raving to me, advocating the destruction of
civilization as we know it, and urging me to follow in his footsteps. I
pretended to agree--since I can be of greater service to you if I'm in
May's confidence."

"So?" said Rudolph thoughtfully. "Tell me about the double. How did
that go wrong?"

"The bunglers were Selene and Almon. Selene because she alarmed me
instead of distracting me. Almon because he failed to recognize her
incompetence."

"They shall be brainburned. That leaves an eighty-ninth-level vacancy
in my organization, doesn't it?"

"You're very kind, sir, but I think I should remain a May's
man--outwardly. If I earn any rewards, I can wait for them. I presume
that May will be elected to wear the five stars. He won't live more
than two years after that, at the rate he is taking drugs."

"We can shorten it," grinned Rudolph. "I have pharmacists who can see
that his drugs are more than normal strength."

"That would be excellent, sir. When he is too enfeebled to discharge
his duties, there may be an attempt to rake up the affair of the double
to discredit you. I could then testify that I was your man all along
and that May coerced me."

They put their heads together, the two saviors of civilization as they
knew it, and conspired ingeniously long into the endless night.
