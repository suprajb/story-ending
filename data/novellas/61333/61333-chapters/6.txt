He watched, incredulous, frozen, thinking that perhaps he'd imagined
the moving of the walls.

But it was not imagination. Slowly, inexorably, the walls were closing
in. Had he put out his arms, he could have touched them on either side
of him.

"Ship!" he said, fighting to keep his voice calm.

"Yes, Mr. Sherwood."

"You are malfunctioning. The walls are closing in."

"No," said the Ship. "No malfunction, I assure you. A very proper
function. My brain grows tired and feeble. It is not the body only--the
brain also has its limits. I suspected that it might, but I could not
know. There was a chance, of course, that separated from the poison of
a body, it might live in its bath of nutrients forever."

"No!" rasped Sherwood, his breath strangling in his throat. "No, not
me!"

"Who else?" asked the Ship. "I have searched for years and you are the
first who fitted."

"Fitted!" Sherwood screamed.

"Why, of course," the Ship said calmly, happily. "A man who would not
be missed. No one knowing where you were. No one hunting for you.
No one who will miss you. I had hunted for someone like you and had
despaired of finding one. For I am humane. I would cause no one grief
or sadness."

The walls kept closing in.

The Ship seemed to sigh in metallic contentment.

"Believe me, Mr. Sherwood," it said, "finding you was a very miracle."
