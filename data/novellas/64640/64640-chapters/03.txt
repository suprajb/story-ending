The dawn jetoff was miserable, as jetoffs always are. Four days brought
the ship within falling-distance of Mars; soon the jets thundered as it
backed into a pocket of hills outside Klamugra. The air-pumps hammered
to bring the air pressure inside the hull gradually down to that of
the outside, so that instruments and equipment wouldn't be subjected
to a sudden lowering of pressure. The men inside the ship slipped
plastic helmets over their heads, checked the tiny air-pumps on their
shoulders, and drew on heavy gloves and boots.

When the port swung open Kim and Barnaby climbed down the ladder to the
blast-blackened sand. The sergeant of EXTS Provost Marshall who had
accompanied them walked with the officers to a hill overlooking the
ancient Martian city of Klamugra, which stood on a terrace about five
kilometers to the north. The red adobe walls of the city, testimony
of the ancient days when Mars had enough water to allow its use for
brick-making, blended with the distance to seem a part of the red
desert sand.

A cloud of steam and dust appeared between the hill where they stood
and the city. Captain Barnaby un-leathered his binoculars and pressed
them to the eyepieces of his helmet, and made out a hopping jeep, its
top enclosed in plastic and a trio of supercharger coils poking through
the sides of the hood. Clouds of steam followed the jeep as its exhaust
streamed out into the chilly air.
