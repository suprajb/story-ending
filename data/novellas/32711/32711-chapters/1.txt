Eve came to him that night wearing the stone marten cape he'd given her
for Christmas. She was a tall, regal blonde, long-legged and gorgeous.
She was half a head taller than Jason Wall, was from Iowa, and had won
the Miss Universe contest two years before. Naturally, since she'd been
voted the world's most beautiful woman, Jason Wall had had to possess
her. He'd given her an outright gift of half a million dollars, and
while most girls would have taken that and gone their way, Eve was
different. Eve only knew it was a ripple on the surface of Jason Wall's
bought happiness. She'd hung around for more. For much more.

"Drink?" Jason Wall asked.

"The usual."
