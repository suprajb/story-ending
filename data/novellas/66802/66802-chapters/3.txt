There was a complete new wardrobe on a chair by the bed, but
Lee--loaded down as he was by unanswered questions--refused to wonder
where it had come from. As he showered, towelled and dressed, his
thoughts were centered upon Mr. Clifford to the exclusion of all else.

Mr. Clifford. Who was he? Why had he done all this? A devious plot of
International Electronics to get one Lee Hayden back on his feet and
on the job again? Lee thought not. Two points stood against this idea.
First, International had definitely charged him off. Second, granted
they were having a last try, their procedure would in no way resemble
the mad pattern of Mr. Clifford.

Then what lay behind this? Was it the amused gesture of a dilettante
philanthropist? No. There was something about this Clifford that put
him a cut above that. He was no idle operator. There was purpose
involved. But what purpose? Daphne had told him he would probably never
see Mr. Clifford again. So how could he ever make any sense out of what
had transpired in the last few hours?

As Lee snatched up his key and headed for the lobby, he told himself,
_She put her hands on my forehead and the headache was gone instantly.
Or did I really have a headache?_

The clerk nodded deferentially. Lee faced him behind his old shield of
belligerence. "My name is Lee Hayden."

"I know, sir."

"I was in room 1106."

The clerk nodded.

"Who rented it for me?"

"Why, Mr. Clifford, sir. I thought you knew."

"I just wanted to find out if _you_ knew." Lee tossed down his key.
"I'm going out."

"Certainly, sir."

"Well?"

"Well, what, sir?"

"The bill. Don't people pay to stay here--or is it a charity
institution?"

"Oh, no sir. We are not a charity institution. But your bill was paid
for by--"

"I know--by Mr. Clifford." Lee scowled and strode out into the street.
