The washing-machine rocking device kept Percival happy all next day, and
his eye was lighted by a particularly bright gleam of elation as he
settled to the fried pork and beans at dinner next night.

“If we just had about one more piece of salt,” mourned Ducky, after
Percival had climbed the ladder, but Dog shook his head. The stick-pin
had cleaned the place of nuggets.

“We’ve done all we can,” he said. “I wish he’d find something of his
own.”

But Ducky shook his head at this. No chance. And yet, come dinner time
next night, here sits Percival again, looking as cocky as a cat that’s
eaten a canary. Throughout the meal Dog and Ducky cast anxious eyes at
him. Percival finished, pushed his plate toward the center of the table,
got up, thrust his hand deep into his right-hand trouser pocket and
brought forth something wrapped in a bit of paper. He unwrapped the
paper and held out for inspection a nugget twice as large as any that
the conspirators had planted for him.

“I worked in new ground today, farther up the creek. Good night.”

They watched him, fascinated, as he climbed the ladder to the loft.

“Suffering crawfish!” hissed Ducky, after he had safely gone.

Dog said nothing at all for a full minute, and then:

“You remember that Swede at Dawson that took a million dollars out of
the place we gave up as no good.”

“I remember,” said Ducky. “Probably nothing to this.”

“Probably not,” agreed Dog, but without conviction. “We’ll see what he
brings home tomorrow night.”
