Next night Percival stoked as usual, pushed back his plate, got up,
fished into his right-hand trouser pocket and produced two nuggets about
the size of the one he had displayed the night before.

Dog cleared his throat and spoke with elaborate casualty.

“Just where are you working now?”

“Up the creek. Around that second bend. Good night.”

Again they watched him climb the ladder. Ducky spoke first.

“That takes him out of our land, onto the free range. All he’s got to do
is stake his claim.”

“I know it. Let’s wait one more day.”

At the end of the day that followed, Percival again ate his dinner,
pushed back his plate and dug into his right-hand trouser pocket,
producing this time three nuggets.

“Getting better,” he said, and started toward the ladder, but this time
Dog called to him.

“Of course a nugget now and then don’t really mean anything.”

“They’re good for money,” said Percival calmly. “After I get enough of
them, I can trade them for three hundred dollars, and that’s what I need
to get back to New York.”

Dog looked at Ducky, and Ducky at Dog. Dog spoke.

“That’s all you want, is it? Three hundred dollars?”

“That’s all.”

“Well--” Dog seemed to hesitate. “If that’s really all you want, maybe
Ducky and I could scrape it up between us.”

“All right. Take me to town tomorrow, and give me three hundred dollars.
Good night.”

Again he started for the ladder, and this time they let him go. Dog
looked at Ducky, and Ducky looked at Dog. Spud Dugan, who had been
standing by, put in an oar.

“You’re going to put this over on him, are you?”

“It’s his own proposition,” said Dog decisively.

“Looks raw to me,” answered Spud. “All I got to say is that money or
anything else that’s come by through sharp practice don’t ever do nobody
no good. I hope you never find a thing after that kid’s gone.”

“Oh, dry up,” said Dog. “What does a poet want with money, anyhow?”
