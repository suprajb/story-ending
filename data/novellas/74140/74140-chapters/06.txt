That night a very tired Percival, but a Percival with a real appetite,
joined them at dinner, stoked himself with beans and fried pork, and
retired immediately afterward to the loft.

“He’s gone cuckoo now,” Spud Dugan told Dog and Ducky, jerking his bald
head toward the ceiling hole. “Been out up the creek all day, panning
for gold.”

“You let him alone,” said Dog.

“Don’t worry.” Spud stacked a precarious load of dishes in the nightly
chore of clearing off. “Letting him alone is what suits me best.”

“You’d better salt that creek some,” Ducky suggested. “Long about ten
o’clock tomorrow morning, that kid’ll get tired of mining. We got
three-four old Klondike nuggets somewhere, aint we?”

Dog nodded, grinning. He went to an old trunk in a far corner of the
sleeping-room, rummaged in it profanely and finally came back with a
small chamois sack which, upended, spewed forth five pieces of rough
gold, each about as big as a shriveled pea.

“We gave away too many souvenirs,” he commented, “but I’ll plant one of
these tomorrow, maybe two the next day, and that’ll leave two for the
day after, and he might just happen to pick up one or two on his own
account.”

“Fat chance, on that creek! You gotta salt it. Get up there first thing,
and put one in the gravel where he’s left his shovel stuck in. A man
always pans that shovelful.”
