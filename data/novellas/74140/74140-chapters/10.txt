They got an early start for town, to catch the stage, and made it. Dog
and Ducky held brief but effective converse with old man Kellifer at the
store, who always had money, and came out of the conference with a roll
of bills, which Dog handed to Percival, just as the stage was ready to
start. Percival gave brief thanks, ran across to the Ideal Cafe for a
moment, then climbed aboard the stage, while Ducky heaved his big bags
into the freight compartment. Duke Envers, the driver, cranked the big
truck, and the engine burst into a violent coughing. Envers got aboard
and started his stage, and Dog and Ducky watched it, until all that was
visible was a fine swirl of dust in the far distance.

“Well, that’s that!” said Dog. “He’s gone, and gone for good. Couldn’t
call him back if we wanted to. Couldn’t catch him.”

“Well, let’s not worry,” answered Ducky. “All I want to do now is to get
back to that creek and find out what we’ve got. How rich do you suppose
it is?”

Dog shook his head.

“Hard telling. The blamed fool didn’t bother to save anything but big
nuggets. No telling how much fine stuff there is.”

Red Leonard stuck his head out of the Ideal Cafe and called:

“Oh, Dog.”
