warming, for the first blast of fuel that would send him Terra-bound.

Nancy Rorke stood watching over his shoulder. "And what would you do if
I would not go with you?"

Sam smiled at her. "I think I'd carry you away regardless."

"I am afraid you would, but I am more afraid you might not, so I go
willingly."

From the doorway Pell said quietly, "The jets are perhaps not so
charming, but they are ready, too."

Sam fed fuel to the jets, and the _Wanderer_ leaped like a hound,
heading for home.
