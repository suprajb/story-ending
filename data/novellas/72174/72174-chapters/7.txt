It was not until the middle of July, when the estate was settled
and Miss Jessica Filburn was securely domiciled with her sister in
California and Charlie Birdsall and Miriam had married and moved into
the inn, that any light was shed upon Wesley's going. Then Charlie, in
moving out Wesley's desk to furnish a new guest room, found the final
page of the Sonimuiran booklet and set up a cry that brought Miriam,
dust-capped and aproned, on the run.

"This is where Wes went," Charlie said.

Miriam pored without comprehension over the lone page. "How do you
know?"

"He got these folders all along from some vacation club," Charlie
explained. "Must have paid his passage in advance, because this one
had tear-off tickets at the bottom.... Where else would he go?"

Miriam sniffed critically at a picture showing a smiling bevy of girls
disporting themselves against a lush semi-tropical background.

Charlie took back the page. "Can't tell where the place is, but it says
here that the climate is about like Samoa's, that there's no trade or
industry and that the population--get this!--is ninety-four and six
tenths female. Even Wes should do all right for himself there."

"He'll be back," Miriam said. "He can't stay long in a place as
expensive as that."

Charlie snorted in disgust. "Would he come back after having Judge
Talbot draw up a paper leaving his bank account to Miss Jessica and his
half of the inn to me, and then disappearing with nothing but a bathing
suit and a pair of sun glasses?"

"He could still come back," Miriam said stubbornly.

An irregularity at the bottom of the page caught Charlie's eye and
settled the issue.

"He can't, either," Charlie said. "He didn't tear out his return
ticket."
