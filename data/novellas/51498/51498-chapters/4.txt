Jim Channing again found himself in Mr. Folan's office. The figures
the tall, sleek-haired man was reading out to him made tuneful music.

comfortingly more than a million.

"Not bad payment, Mr. Channing, for five years of life! In any case,

When he had come out of the stupor that succeeded the almost
disintegrating effects of his re-metamorphosis, Jim Channing remembered
clearly the terms of the bargain he had made. He was to become a Jube,
a living nightmare, living in a nightmare world, for five years. At the

back his humanity and he would have earned enough money to keep him in
luxury for the rest of his life.

They had kept their promise--to the letter. He felt it ungrateful
of him that his paramount emotion was fury. He had been happy; no
human attachment could ever make him as happy again. He longed for
the glorious love and trust he had shared during that tremendous five
years. Perhaps he had been a repulsive monster from whom any woman
would run screaming. But he didn't want a woman. He wanted Aln Muh.

metamorphosis be possible?"
