Fortunately the great rocks formed a cavern above us. After two days we
were rescued. The others had suffered such minor injuries that they were
repaired before our craft landed on Nirva. I, though, unconscious and
feverish, was in serious condition from skin abrasions and a comminuted
cranium. Dr. Erics made the only possible prognosis. My skull had to be
removed and a completely new protoskin had to be supplied also.
