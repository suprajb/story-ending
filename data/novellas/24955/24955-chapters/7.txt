The operating theatre was crowded for my final performance and several
Tri-D video cameras stared down at me. Pupils, lights and lenses, all
came to a glittering focus on me. I slowly closed my eyes to blot the
hypnotic horror out.

But when I opened them everything was still there as before. Then Erics'
head, growing as he inspected my face more closely, covered everything
else up.

"When are you going to begin?" I demanded.

"We have _finished_," he answered in awe that verged upon reverence.
"You are the new Adam!"

There was a mounting burst of applause as the viewers learned what I had
said. My mind was working more clearly than it had in a long time and,
with all the wisdom of hindsight, I wondered how anyone could have ever
doubted the outcome. We had known all along that every bit of atomic
matter in each cell is replaced many times in one lifetime, electron by
electron, without the cell's overall form disappearing. Now, by equally
gradual steps, it had happened in the vaster arena of Newtonian living
matter.

I sat up slowly, looking with renewed wonder on everything from the
magnetic screw in the light above my head to the nail on the wriggling
toe of my left foot. I was more than Achilles' Ship. I was a living
being at whose center lay a still yet turning point that could neither
be new nor old but only immortal.
