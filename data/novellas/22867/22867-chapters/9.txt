Much later, Walter Towne and Jeff Bates pried the trophies off the wall
of the big office. The lawyer shook his head sadly. "Pity about Dan
Torkleson. Gruesome affair."

Walter nodded as he struggled down with a moose head. "Yes, a pity, but
you know the boys when they get upset."

"I suppose so." The lawyer stopped to rest, panting. "Anyway, with the
newly elected board of directors, things will be different for
everybody. You took a long gamble."

"Not so long. Not when you knew what they wanted to hear. It just took a
little timing."

"Still, I didn't think they'd elect you secretary of the union. It just
doesn't figure."

Walter Towne chuckled. "Doesn't it? I don't know. Everything's been a
little screwy since the switchover. And in a screwy world like this--"
He shrugged, and tossed down the moose head. "_Anything_ figures."
