"I'm not an unreasonable man," Torkleson was saying miserably, waving
his fat paws in the air as he paced back and forth in front of the
spokesmen for the striking managers. "Perhaps we were a little
demanding, I concede it! Overenthusiastic with our ownership, and all
that. But I'm sure we can come to some agreement. A hike in wage scale
is certainly within reason. Perhaps we can even arrange for better
company houses."

Walter Towne stifled a yawn. "Perhaps you didn't understand us. The men
are agitating for a meeting of the board of directors. We want to be at
that meeting. That's the only thing we're interested in right now."

"But there wasn't anything about a board meeting in the contract your
lawyer presented."

"I know, but you rejected that contract. So we tore it up. Anyway, we've
changed our minds."

Torkleson sat down, his heavy cheeks quivering. "Gentlemen, be
reasonable! I can guarantee you your jobs, even give you a free hand
with the management. So the dividends won't be so large--the men will
have to get used to that. That's it, we'll put it through at the next
executive conference, give you--"

"The board meeting," Walter said gently. "That'll be enough for us."

The union boss swore and slammed his fist on the desk. "Walk out in
front of those men after what you've done? You're fools! Well, I've
given you your chance. You'll get your board meeting. But you'd better
come armed. Because I know how to handle this kind of board meeting, and
if I have anything to say about it, this one will end with a massacre."
