When Locke had gone and Moira had exhausted her fund of excited
small talk, Boyle went over the entire plan again from inception to
conclusion. Lying awake in the darkness with only the sound of Moira's
even breathing breaking the stillness, he let his practical fancy run
ahead.

Years, decades, generations--what were they? To be by relative
standards undying in a world of ephemerae, with literally nothing that
he might not have or do....

He dreamed a dream as old as man, of stretching today into forever.

Immortality.
