sat down quickly and began speaking before any greeting could be
exchanged.

"I have decided to accept your last proposal. I specify the meeting
place as the deserted weather station at the old settlement of Tharviana
in the Byrd-Ellsworth Sector of Antarctica. Date to be Seventhday of
Fried Pie Week. Advance cadres of personnel from both sides should meet
at the site two weeks earlier to make repairs and preparations. Do you
agree?"

Ivan nodded impatiently, his dark eyes watching the President closely.
Smith went on to suggest limits for the size of both cadres, their
equipment, and the kind of transportation. Ivan made only one
suggestion: that the details, such as permissible arms and standards of
conduct, be left to the cadre commanders to settle between themselves
before the leaders' parties arrived.

"Your continual espionage activities," Smith said coldly, "do not
recommend your government as one to be trusted in the matter of
agreements without guarantees. My cadre commander will be instructed as
to details."

The Asian grunted. "You speak of trust, yet violate it in advance by
preparing an assault against us."

They glared at each other. After a few more words, the conversation
ended abruptly, and the matter was tentatively settled.
