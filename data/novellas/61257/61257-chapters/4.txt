Well, we are two universal days out from Newtane and soon we will drop
from hyper-drive as we reach the orbit of Pluto. I shouldn't still
be feeling as uneasy as I do. I'm sure I shouldn't. We have had five
friendly, informative days with the people of a great civilization
remarkably like ours, and President Hacker has radioed he understands
perfectly that we were not responsible for the tragedy, nobody was. The
kid, it seems, wasn't the apple of his eye anyway.

Ninety men and one corpse returning to the security of _terra firma_.
I should, when all is said and done, be happy with the way most things
have worked out. But I am a Chronicler and I know the peculiarly
symbolic, seemingly superficial ways in which history manages to repeat
itself.

It is more than three centuries since the last war on Earth between
rightists and leftists. That was a matter of differing concepts of
economics and politics. I can't help wondering, though, whether there
are not even more fundamental points of eventual conflict in the
universe that we have barely discovered. If there are, I'm beginning
to suspect they'll still have something to do with the unfathomable
difference between Right and Left, a difference that took many lives
centuries ago--and may not be through with us yet.
