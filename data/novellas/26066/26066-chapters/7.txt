as they lay on the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility overcame

"So sorry--an accident--inconceivable. I can't see how he got it! We got
you back as soon as we could find a focus. I sincerely hope you haven't
been injured."

"Why--what--what--"

"Why I happened in, found our operator drunk. I've no idea where he got

"I can't imagine how it happened. I've had the fellow locked up, and
the 'dry-laws' are on the job. I hope you won't hold us for excessive

I don't want him to suffer for it in any way. My wife and I will be
perfectly satisfied to get back to our apartment."

"I don't wonder. You look like you've been through--I don't know what.
But I'll have you there in five minutes. My private car--"
