The redhead flung herself on a cot and groaned.

"What a day!" she said.

"It wasn't so bad," said Cleveland, looking in the mirror and feeling
better about the looks of her hair.

"Wasn't that questionnaire a beauty?" said the blonde girl, this time
wearing a purple sweater. "'Please check your birth certificate when
giving age,'" she quoted. "You know, I don't think they trust us."

"That domestic science test wasn't too hard," said the brunette.

"At least I didn't burn everything," said the redhead. "But did you get
a load of that cooking equipment? I swear, I haven't seen junk like
that since I went to an antique auction in New Jersey."

"Well, I guess they just don't have modern facilities--"

"You can say that again! Back home, we just put the food in the
gadget, press the button, and whammo. This stuff is practically
_primitive_."

"Say, did you see the face on that Captain Lester when he tasted that
strawberry cake of mine?"

"Gee, he's cute. If I was running this thing, I'd make it a law that
nice-looking guys like him get Earthbound jobs--"

"That photography business was something. I haven't been snapped so
much since that Shutterbug show in Chicago--"

"Hey, Janie, what happened to your second-looie? I didn't see him
around all day. What'd you do to him last night?"

"No, we couldn't get inside the hangar, but we saw enough. Honest, that
spaceship is a _dream_. It's so _white_, I mean, just like that sheath
dress I packed--"

"Say, when do we get a chance to wear some decent _clothes_, for Pete's
sake? I'm sick of these damn shorts and halters--"

"Settle down, dear. Wednesday's the big day--"

"God, I'm tired! I don't know if I'll ever survive that endurance test
tomorrow, whatever _that_ is--"

"Lights out at nine tonight, girls--"

"I'd give fifty bucks for some food right now. I'd even eat something I
made myself."

"Who wants to be Miss Outer Space anyway--"
