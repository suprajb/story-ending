The field trucks drove back just fourteen girls from the Play Area.
Lt. Hartwig was surprised at the low number, after his first hard-eyed
appraisal of the women. But a hundred and sixty-six of them had stuck
it out, with a perseverance that didn't quite fit his preconceived
idea about the durability of young women--particularly the kind of
young women who entered beauty contests.

But they stuck. They walked the four-mile distance to the test grounds
with playful good humor. They took the hurdles of the obstacle course
with only minor accidents. They joined in the water trials with gleeful
abandon. And they even forgot their aching feet when the whistle blew
for the running events.

The blonde that Hartwig had dated proved a frost in the first ten
minutes of the exercises. She balked at the obstacle course, and
pulled a fit of weeping. Hartwig himself helped her off the grounds,
and tried to be nice about it. But she seemed to want to blame him for
everything, and gave the young officer a tongue-lashing that brought a
blush to his face. She sat out the rest of the field trials in a truck,
waiting to be driven home. But that other blonde one, the pert one with
the curls and the stunning figure, the one from Cleveland; now that was
something more to Hartwig's liking. And the way she had taken the whole
thing with such dignity and good grace. He'd have to talk with her on
the way back....

"Okay, girls!" he called to them cheerfully, as they began the weary
trudge back to the spaceport. "I know you're all bushed, but if we
put a little pep into it, we can get back at two-thirty or so. That
will give you some time to freshen up before the outer-space question
period. You'll probably want to do some repair work on the makeup."
