It was Show Night.

The trunks flew open, and dazzling gowns of silk and satin and nylon
and orlon and sprylon were brought out, rustling beautifully. The
long row of cabins on the edge of the Omaha Spaceport crackled with
girlish excitement as the entrants dressed for the final judging. There
were shrieks and giggles, screams and guffaws, cries of delight and
of misery as the women struggled into their prettiest dresses. The
sounds of their activity carried all across the spaceport, jangling the
nerves--but not unpleasantly--of the personnel in the barracks at the
other end of the field. It was Show Night, after all, the final moment
when Miss Outer Space would be selected and crowned, and even the most
hard-bitten veteran on the base caught some of the fever.
