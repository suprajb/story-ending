Second Lieutenant Hartwig set his shoulders squarely as he faced the
ranks of women.

"The exercises will be held at the Spaceport Play Area," he said
crisply. "That's not quite four miles from here. The tests will last
about two hours, so if we make good time we can be back here before
three."

"What about lunch?" asked a small voice.

"We'll get our lunch at the Play Area. It won't be anything much,
sandwiches mostly. As I say, we must be back here at three, so you
ladies can take your outer-space question period. That's the last phase
of the contest, except for Show Night tomorrow, of course."

"How do we get there?" asked the redhead, in the front rank.

"We walk," the lieutenant said grimly.

"_Walk?_" A chorus of disapproval came from the girls, mixed with some
resigned groans.

"That's right," said the lieutenant. "It's not as far as you think,
and there'll be field wagons for those who are too tired to walk back
after the tests. I needn't tell you," he added, "that walking back
might count against your score. But it's your privilege."

"Nice guy," said the redhead bitterly, out of the side of her mouth.
The blonde, Janie, who had dated him on their first night, looked hurt.
"He _seemed_ nice," she said. "He was so sweet about things--"

"Let's cut out the chatter," said the young officer. "Pretend you're in
the Army now, girls. No talking in ranks, and let's have some semblance
of marching order."

"My feet hurt already," said Maria.

"This stinks," said the redhead tersely. "I knew I should have quit
yesterday--"

"Not me," said Cleveland. "I got this far. They won't bully me out of
it now!"
