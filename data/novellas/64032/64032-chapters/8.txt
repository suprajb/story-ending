Doran's assessment of a situation in plain talk took away its dread for
Joe, giving his Mars-love a chance. He began to feel at home. "Is my
wife talking sense?" he asked puzzledly.

Kettrich and Lorring had both been fascinated by this world,
too--willing to devote years to it.

"Well, we can still radio Port Laribee," Lorring chuckled. "But in any
case we're stuck here for a long time. Meanwhile, there's food growing
wild around us. There's water. There are tools, machines, and supplies
to puzzle out. And a valley to reclaim as a start. Beyond that, the job
gets bigger and more interesting."

Before sunset that day, Joe and Doran Dayton walked alone in the
valley. The Earth-star was already silvery in the dark blue west. The
hills were dun-hued and peaceful. The domes of the Mars-ants gleamed.
Fantastic spring flowers wavered in the wind. Small dust-whirls stirred
among the ruins.

Joe Dayton looked forward, gladly now, to the birth of his child on the
Red Planet.

"I hope that the Neo-Martians won't become so separate that they'll
forget to be friends with Terrans," Doran mused.

Joe nodded as his arm crept around her waist. To him legendary history
and present fact had merged. The wind's rustle was no longer the
whisper of the dead past.
