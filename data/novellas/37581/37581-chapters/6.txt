Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired. Varied hyphenation was retained
such as teaboard and tea-board.

Text uses both hers and her's and yours and your's.

Page 33, "care" changed to "Care" (Care.' Yes, yes, it's)

Page 121, "controul" changed to "control" (resisted his control)

Page 130, "emphasied" changed to "emphasised" (Miss Slowboy emphasised)
