The only trouble was, there seemed to be fewer and fewer new plans
as the years went by. And now, even when you found some, you had to
check its potentialities exhaustively before you started building it.
Markten shuddered a little when he thought of some of the first things
that had been built without preconstruction study for analysis as to
its probable use. One of them would have blown New City off the face
of the earth had it been put into operation in a metropolitan proving
lab. Fortunately, the thing had been too big, and had been taken for
trial to a lab located in a southern desert. Today, there was still a
ten-mile wide crater in the sand where the thing had gone off.

Production never got that model from Research. There were some others
of similar nature that they hadn't got, too....

That was why, these days, even if you dug something up, you were damn
careful before you built it.

"Say, Markten!"

"Yes?"

"I was wondering about something. Eventually, we're bound to find all
the plans there are. What happens when there aren't anymore?"

"Maybe then there'll be time for that other stuff I caught you wasting
time on in the ruin we were in last week!" There was a grin on
Markten's thin face. "But not until!"

"No, seriously, Markten. The division academy instructors said there
wasn't much left, and that was why we had to be especially well
trained, to find what little more there is. But what about after we do,
and there just isn't anymore?"

"Just--build more of what we've got, of course. What else would there
be to do?"

"Well--well, you must be right. But Production sure will be dull."
