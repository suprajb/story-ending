Again came the brief sizzle of corona, the urge of magnetic attraction,

Newton reached for the sample.

"No!" said Velikof quickly.

"Why?"

Mangler grunted. "You've been as sloppy as a kid," he sneered. "That
sample is probably as hot as it was."

"But you have the right process," said Velikof. "And now I must get
going."

Shrugging, Newton took up the tongs, lifted the sample from its place,
and thrust it in front of the counter.

The counter was silent.

"Dead!" glowed Newton.

"Hmmmm."

Velikof turned back from the door. "Dead?" he said. "Dead?"

"Dead," said Newton. "I couldn't have been as sloppy as you accused me

"Maybe the thing isn't as demanding as you suggest," said Mangler.

"We'll find out," said Newton; "Howard, help me pack up."

"Sure."

Velikof shook his head. He handed the envelope back to Newton.

Newton took it, wonderingly. "Why?"

"I'm not selling," said Velikof.

"But you did sell. It's mine--ours."

"You took your envelope back."

Mangler growled. "Not if I have anything to say about it!"

Velikof eyed Mangler, looked the big man up and down. "But this isn't--"

Mangler flexed his hands. "You can't play that game with us," he
snarled. "What do you want--more money?"

"I want my machine. It has just occurred to me that I know how to
exploit it for myself, in safety from my countrymen."

"Well, you can't back out of a contract that easily."
