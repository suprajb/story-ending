I was so stirred by hearing about this successful conclusion of Captain
Hannah's mission that I shook his hand warmly and ordered a round of
drinks for everyone in the room. Fortunately, it was not very crowded
at the time.

"That's not quite the end of the story," said the skipper. "You see,
the Prinkip had built the pond to keep Beulah in. He had somehow gotten
the idea that I was bringing him a whale."

I looked blank.

"An Earth mammal. It lives in the oceans, and runs to maybe seventy or
eighty tons."

I sat down slowly, and then made a sudden dive for my contract for the
use of the _Delta Crucis_.

The skipper nodded. "I had a contingent contract with the Prinkip,
too," he said, "and I hadn't delivered. I still haven't figured out how
to make delivery of a whale, but I will some day.

"And if you're looking for that part of our contract where you agree to
store any residual cargo I may be carrying, it's all legal and binding.
Until I get back from hauling your Gasha root, you'll have to care for
one adult female African elephant. But I'm sure you'll get to like
Beulah as much as I have. She's a mighty clever elephant."

I called the waiter over and ordered a beaker of rhial.

"But you're lucky at that," said Hannah. "Check subparagraph f of
paragraph 74 of our contract: Incidental accrual. When Beulah has her
baby, the little tyke will be all yours."

Now I know why Captain Hannah drinks rhial in the morning.

So do I.
