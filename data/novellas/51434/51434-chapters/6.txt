"That's it," said Captain Hannah. "Compost heap. Well, I started the
journey with the ship full and Beulah and the compost heap empty. I
finished pretty much the other way around. I suppose it sounds easy,
but it wasn't.

"I started off with Beulah chained down in the middle of the
compartment, and everything stacked around her. She didn't want me
to leave when I went up to the bridge to take off, and hollered
as piteously as you can imagine. But I couldn't have a nurse for
her--mahout, they call them. I couldn't spare the weight. Or the
salary, for that matter. She was chained down, so she couldn't move
around and upset the balance.

"After chemical take off, we slid into parking orbit as sweet as you
please. I hurried down to shift the load around. I didn't want to stay
weightless any longer than I had to, because I remembered that sick
Indian elephant--and Beulah outweighed him by almost two tons, and had
a larger stomach to match. Of course, the Indian elephant had gone into
orbit on a full belly, and I hadn't let Beulah have a bite to eat for
hours. It made a difference, let me tell you.

"Beulah made trouble in her own way, though. As soon as I got within
reach, she grabbed me with that long nose of hers, and wouldn't let
go. She didn't hurt me or anything like that; she just wanted company
in her misery. I couldn't coax her with food. The very thought of food
made her shudder.

"I couldn't reach her chains to cut her loose, and I couldn't reach the
radio to call for help. If it hadn't been for the Ionosphere Guard, I
might have starved to death. I'd hired the parking orbit for twelve
hours, and when I was still in it after that time, Port Control started
to holler. I could hear them on my loud speaker, but I couldn't answer
them. So the Ionosphere Guard finally sent up a small craft with a
lieutenant and a three-man crew in it to see what was wrong.
