Then the leader emerged and stood to one side of the long line that
pattered through the hole. The two humans stared, fascinated, as the
line made straight for the back door and under it. SK540 stayed where
he was.

"Will they go back to the lab?" Norah asked.

Philip shrugged.

"It doesn't matter. Some of them may ... I feel like a traitor."

"I don't. I feel like one of those people who hid escaped war prisoners
in Europe."

When the rats were all gone, they turned to SK540. But without a glance
at them he re-entered the hiding-place. In a minute he returned,
herding two white rats before him. He stood still, obviously expectant.

Philip squatted on his heels. He picked up the two refugees and looked
them over.

"Both females," he announced briefly. "And both pregnant."

"Is he the father?"

"Who else? He'd see to that."

"And will they inherit his--his--"

"His 'super-ratism'? That's the whole point. That's the object of the
entire experiment. They were going to try it soon."

The three white rats had scarcely moved. The two mothers-to-be had
apparently fallen asleep. Only SK540 stood quietly eying the humans.
When they left him to find a place where they could talk in private he
did not follow them.

"It comes down to this," Philip said at the end of half an hour's
fruitless discussion. "We promised him, or as good as. He believed us
and trusted us.

"But if we keep to our promise we're _really_ traitors--to the human
race."

"You mean, if the offspring should inherit his brain-power, they might
overrun us all?"

"Not might. Would."

"So--"

"So it's an insoluble problem, on our terms. We have to think of this
as a war, and of them as our enemies. What is our word of honor to a
rat?"

"But to a super-rat--to SK540--"

As if called, SK540 appeared.

Had he been listening? Had he understood? Neither of them dared to
voice the question aloud in his presence.

"Later," Philip murmured.

"We must eat," said Norah. "Let's see what's left in the way of food."
