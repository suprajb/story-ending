Everything tasted flat; they weren't very hungry after all. There was
enough left over to feed the three rats. But they had evidently helped

Neither of the humans guessed what else had vanished from the pantry

sprinkled on the remaining contents of the icebox, wherever the white
powder would not show.

They did not know until it was too late--until both of them lay
writhing in their last spasms on their bedroom floor.

By the time the house was broken into and their bodies found, SK540 and
his two wives were far away, and safe....

And this, children, is the true account, handed down by tradition from
the days of our great Founder, of how the human race ceased to exist
and we took over the world.
