Well, I began to feel well enough to sit up and take notice along about
lunch time. Doug Enderby, the steward of our void-cavorting madhouse,
brought me my grub. He tiptoed in and laid the tray on the desk before
me. He whispered:

"Are you feeling better, Bert?"

"Never worse," I told him gloomily. "Why the crape on the victuals? Are
they _that_ bad?"

I whipped off the napkin, took one gander at my so-called "lunch," and
bleated like a branded sheep.

"Great monsoons of Mars--what the hell is this?"

"Shhh!" hushed Enderby. "Poached eggs, Sparks."

"I can see them!" I hollered. I stared at the pair of baleful, golden
horrors-on-toast. "And they can see _me_, too! Take 'em away!"

Enderby said petulantly, "But you're sick! That's what Captain Cooper
said."

"Cooper, eh?" I groaned. "I always said it wasn't smart to make torture
illegal." Then I remembered why I was confined to durance vile. "You
seen Biggs?" I asked.

"No. He hasn't been down to lunch. He had to take over for you when you
were taken ill." Doug looked anxious. "There--there's something wrong
in your turret, Sparks. The intercommunications system is out, and the
radio won't work."

I glanced at my watch. Two hours had passed since Cooper's coup. Hardly
time for Lanse to unscramble the mess of pottery.

"Well, cheer up," I said. "Everything will be O.Q. in a little while.
Uggh!" I pushed my toast and tea toward him. "Look, pal, how's the cow
situation in the galley? You got a nice, three inch steak? Rare? With
onions?"

"Sirloins," said Doug, "for dinner."

"In that case," I sighed, "I'll give this hen-fruit a miss. See you at
dinner-time."

Doug nodded sagely and sidled toward the doorway.

"Steaks," he said, "for the crew. But _you_ get milk toast. You're a
sick ma--_Hey!_"

Well, I _almost_ nailed him with that second poached egg, anyway.
