Outside in the corridor, Magnan came up to Retief, who stood talking to
a tall man in a pilot's coverall.

"I'll be tied up, sending through full details on my--our--your
recruiting theme, Retief," Magnan said. "Suppose you run into the city
to assist the new Verpp Consul in settling in."

"I'll do that, Mr. Magnan. Anything else?"

Magnan raised his eyebrows. "You're remarkably compliant today, Retief.
I'll arrange transportation."

"Don't bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy here will run me over. He was the pilot
who ferried us over to Roolit I, you recall."

"I'll be with you as soon as I pack a few phone numbers, Retief," the
pilot said. He moved off. Magnan followed him with a disapproving eye.
"An uncouth sort, I fancied. I trust you're not consorting with his
kind socially."

"I wouldn't say that, exactly," Retief said. "We just want to go over a
few figures together."
