Did you read about the situation in this morning's papers? It looks
like another crisis in the making and maybe this time neither side will
back down.

Pray for a year's time, if you're the praying kind.

But whenever the missiles come, Benjamin will press the red button at
the first warning. The temporal field lasts only a millisecond and the
missiles won't be stopped, of course--but every city with a suitcase
will be empty when they strike.

If the crisis holds off for a year, Benjamin figures we'll all go
back together, each city and town to a different time, but all before
1900. It's hard to wait even a year when you have the gene gnawing and
nagging inside you....

Edgar Evans, who started it, couldn't wait. Andover Hare refused to go
back alone. Benjamin Reeves, with the same gene, was unable to forget
what he told the military--run like hell!--and all the folks like us
who couldn't.

So Benjamin found us the ultimate way to run, and to satisfy our dream
in the running. Not yet, but soon now.

_See you back there!_
