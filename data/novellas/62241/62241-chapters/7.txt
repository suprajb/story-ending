I sprang to my feet, unable to remain still any longer. De Long stared.
"Is aught amiss?" he exclaimed anxiously.

"No--nothing," I muttered, and the lie detector needle leaped clear
against its stop pins. "That is--I rather think we'll be leaving Earth
before very long." With lame excuses, we managed to get the Earthman
outside.

Captain Tutwa thoroughly agreed with me that we must leave this noxious
planet at once, never to return, and that Earth must be declared unfit
for Martian colonization. I can solemnly say that the Blue Planet is
a veritable inferno; we of Mars will do well to keep clear of it in
future interplanetary explorations.

I am sure that you can well see that Earth can never be colonized from
Mars, that it must be forever shunned as a plague spot. If any of our
hot-headed youth is now so foolhardy as to brave the horrors of that
planet of fear, their blood is on their own heads.

    In the 75th day of the 242nd year of the invention of the steam
    engine,

    (Signed)

    Shapplo with the Long Proboscis,
    Interpreter, First Earth Expedition.
