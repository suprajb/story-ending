I was struck by the beautiful simplicity of this idea, which should
have been right in my province.

"I leave it to you to maneuver de Long into a position where we can use
the detector without his knowledge," said the captain.

"Very well," I said joyfully.

It was not difficult to get de Long aboard the ship; he had never had
a chance to satisfy his curiosity concerning it. I showed him through
several of the cabins without doing anything to arouse his suspicions,
and finally got him seated within the effective radius of the lie
detector.

"Er--I've been wondering about--about those werewolves you were telling
me of, Sir Henry," I improvised. "Just what are their habits?"

"They are a dangerous sort of demon," replied the Earthman readily. "By
day they appear to be ordinary men, save that they may be distinguished
by the first finger of the right hand being longer than the second;
but in the dead of night the craving for human flesh comes upon them,
they grow hairy, their nails become claws and their jaws lengthen, and
they are wolves. They may not be slain by any weapon while in the beast
form, but must be taken in human shape."

I quivered in spite of myself. The lie detector indicator had not moved
from center--what he was saying must be the dreadful truth!

"Are--are they the worst sort of fiend common around here?" I ventured
to ask.

De Long constricted the skin above his eyes judiciously. "The vampire
is likewise a direful demon, though little known in these parts," he
declared. "It is the soul of an unsanctified corpse, which rises in the
night from its grave and goes forth to suck blood and life from living
men."
