Slowly I dragged myself to the telephone and pulled it from the stand.
I remember nothing else until they brought me here.

It's been eight days--eight days away from death, yet I'm closer to
it now than ever before. And I can't _think_ of it. The fear has come
crashing through and I can't _think_.

This thing, this body is too far gone. I won't be able to make it move.
I'll just feel it getting away--little by little--ripping apart cell by
cell, and then everywhere all at once.

I can feel it now. But in that great silence, I could almost hear the
tearing--yet there was no sound.

The doctors have given up all hope. I can see it in their faces. I
could hear them talking among themselves when they brought me in. They
had to give it a name. There's a certain safety in a name, you know.

I would have told them, but I was afraid they'd laugh. The nurses would
laugh and say to each other, "Have you heard what the one in 408 wanted
in his case history?"

I couldn't stand the laughter now.

But that's the way my chart should read--Cause of Death:--_Death!_
