Zack did the most important chores and at eight A.M. on the dot he
called the State University.

The operator at the switchboard answered sleepily.

"Good morning, State University."

"Mornin', ma'am. I'd like to talk to one of them scientist fellas."

"To whom in particular did you wish to speak?"

"Any of 'em that ain't busy. I got somethin' important to tell 'em."

"If I knew what it was about," the operator was becoming irritated, "I'd
connect you with the right party."

Zack hesitated, reluctant to give his startling news to a mere operator.
Instead, he hedged. "Well, who would have charge of things that light
up?"

"Oh, you want the electrical engineering lab. Just a moment, sir."

There was a series of clicks and buzzes in the earpiece then Zack heard
a man's deep voice.

"Hello."

"Hello," Zack replied, "this the electrical engineering lab?"

"Yessir, that's right."

"Well, my name is Zack Stewart and I own a forty-acre farm on the Canal
Road just outside of Smithville."

"I'm Professor Donnell, can I help you?"

"Yeah," Zack took a deep breath then began, "my cow Junius was missing
since yesterday morning and this morning when I went out to search for
her again, I found her."

"Mr. Stewart," Professor Donnell's voice was impatient, "I'm a very busy
man with a heavy class schedule. Why in the world would I care if you
found your cow or not?"

"You'd care if you knew how I found her."

"Alright, Mr. Stewart, how did you find your cow, with some new kind of
radar?"

"Nossir, I found her by following the bright light in the north wood and
when I got there, there was Junius lit up like a neon sign."

"Mr. Stewart, are you drunk?"

"I knew you wouldn't believe me. All I can say is, come see for--"

Zack heard a sudden click then an immediate buzzing. Professor Donnell
had hung up.
