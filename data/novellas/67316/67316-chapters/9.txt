Dusk. A silence blanketed the take-off field. The seconds hung in the
air like bits of fire and ice.

Captain George Everson, the man with no legs, waved to the multitude
as he entered his silver rocket.

Presently there was a sound of thunder, and the land trembled. Flame
belched from the stern of the _Lunar Lady_. Slowly, the rocket began to
rise. The multitude drew back, like frightened red ghosts in the fiery
glare from the grumbling jets.

A greater avalanche of flame spewed from the rocket. A furnace-hot wind
shrilled over the field, lashing at hair and clothing, at banner and
flag.

And suddenly the _Lunar Lady_ was gone. It was a needle of fire high in
the twilight sky, a vanishing target for a million narrowed eyes.

A hushed, reverent murmur rose from the field.

A small girl in a pink party dress tugged at her mother's skirt.

"Look, Mommy," she whispered. "Look at that funny old man. He keeps
saying, 'This is for you,' and he's crying and laughing at the same
time!"
