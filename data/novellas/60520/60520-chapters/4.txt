When Pete found out how his wife had gone about standing by him, he was
almost shocked speechless. Almost.

"You signed up as my replacement on the Proxima expedition! But you
can't! It's no job for a woman! And you're leaving me alone--for seven
or eight years! They won't take you!"

"They already did." She smiled bravely at him. "As the wife of a
retired serviceman I had preference. We need the extra money, Pete. And
it won't be for long. When I come back, we'll still be young enough to
enjoy life, darling. And they pay well--a few years of sacrifice now
will make so much difference in our future...."

Pete closed his eyes and thought of how many times he had said the same
words to starry eyed young women. It won't be long ... we'll still be
young ... good pay....

Her loving lips tenderly brushed his dark hair.
