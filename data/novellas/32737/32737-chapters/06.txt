Dimly through succeeding days Chet was aware of the ship's sickbay, of
the enlisted attendants, the hovering doctor, the silent commander.
Later he realized he'd been kept under opiates so his body could recover
while his mind rested. At the time, he felt only the dimness.

It wore off abruptly. He was in a civilized cot, stretching luxuriously,
aware of warmth and comfort and a cheerful voice that seemed familiar.

He opened his eyes. A fat young corpsman had been watching.

"How do you feel, sir?" the boy said. "Ready for coffee?"

"Sure," Chet answered. And grinned lazily as he sat up to sip the
proffered cup. "You've taken good care of me."

"Used to be a barber in civilian life," the boy said smugly. And Chet
found with an exploratory hand that he'd been shaven and shorn, bathed,
bandaged where necessary--even, he saw, clad in a pair of fancy red
broadcloth pajamas.

"You've got me cleaned up, all right," he said. "Whose p.j.'s have I got
on?"

"Dr. Pine's, sir. You'll see him in a couple of minutes--he and the Old
Man been waiting to question you. There's a robe and slippers, if you
want me to help you get up...."

"I'm not helpless," Chet said, boasting in his turn. He proved it by
climbing--gingerly--out of the cot. The boy helped him into the robe,
found the slippers, pushed the small room's one chair an inch closer to
the open porthole, and left, closing the door behind him.
