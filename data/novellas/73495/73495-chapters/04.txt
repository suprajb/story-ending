After lunch, Philip Merriwether lost the job he had held for five years.

At seven o'clock that night, he sat in a small bar, sipping
disconsolately at a glass of Coca-Cola. Not knowing where he was going
to get another job, he was trying to drown his thoughts in soda-water
and television. The show on the screen was "You Can't Lose," a quiz
show produced by the Boltman Automobile Corporation.

The quizmaster was grinning sardonically at the hapless contestant.
"You have arrived at the fifty thousand dollar question," he said.
"Since you chose geometry as your category, the question will be on
that subject. Are you ready?"

The contestant nodded unhappily.

"All right, here's the question: What is the value of _pi_ to eight
decimal places?"

Before the contestant could say a word, Phil muttered: "Three point
one four one five nine two six five--plus." He didn't notice what the
contestant said, but the quizmaster shook his head in mock sorrow. "I'm
sorry, sir, but the correct answer is: three point one four one five
nine two six five. Better luck next time."

The coarse, unshaven man standing next to Phil looked at him in awe.
"Hey, buddy," he said, "that's the ninth time you've answered right.
Why don't you get on that program and make yourself some dough?"

Phil blinked at his Coke and thought it over. Then his face brightened.
"Yeah," he said, grinning, "why don't I?"
