It was several hours later that Dr. Wolstadt was rushed into Phil's
cell. He was so excited that his German accent became much heavier than
usual.

"Is this the chentleman? _Ach!_ It's amazing! How did it happen? You
were standing right in the path of the ray, _nein_?"

"I think so, Dr. Wolstadt. Didn't you suspect what effect the beam
might have had?"

"Never!" said the physicist. "Not until I saw your mathematics. It's
unbelievable to think this could happen!"

"For Heaven's sake!" said the President. "What happened?"

Wolstadt turned around to face the Chief Executive.

"It's very simple. The derivation of the Q-beam that I have been
working on got out of control for a second. It went through all my
files, and all the files in the Pentagon, and Heaven only knows what
else. It picked up all that information and put it in Mr. Merriwether's
mind!"

"Amazing!" said the President.

"Fantastic!" said the Secretary of Defense.

"Will it work with anybody?" the President asked.

Dr. Wolstadt shook his head. "No. This is a most unusual case. Mr.
Merriwether, according to the FBI reports, had a terrible memory before
the accident happened. He is actually a very intelligent man, but he
always forgot things, and that made him look stupid.

"But, fortunately, it meant that his memory was almost a total blank.
Therefore, the ray could implant all this data on his memory.

"It's like recording something on an L-P disc. If it already has
music on it, the recorder just ruins the disc. But if it's blank, the
recorder puts music on it. You see?"

"Then if it had hit anyone but me--" Phil began.

"--it would probably have driven them insane," said Dr. Wolstadt.

"That still leaves us the problem of what to do with Mr. Merriwether,"
said the President.

"I think I have an idea," Phil said. "Want to hear it?"
