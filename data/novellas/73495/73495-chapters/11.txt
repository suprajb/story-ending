Some months later, two men arrived by air in the city of Moscow. One of
them went directly to the American Embassy. In his brief case was a
small, very compact machine.

The Ambassador shook his hand warmly. "The President told me to give
you the run of the place, Dr. Wolstadt. What are you going to do?"

"I'm sorry," said Wolstadt, "but I cannot tell even you. All I require
is a room in the Embassy which faces the Kremlin."

"That can be arranged. But where is your companion? I understood there
were to be two of you."

"He is, shall we say, taking a stroll around Moscow."

"But he can't do that!" the Ambassador said. "The President said he was
the most valuable man on Earth! He might get arrested."

"That is the chance we have to take. Now if you'll show me to that
room, I'll go about my business."

Some distance away, on the opposite side of the Kremlin from the
American Embassy, Philip Merriwether, the most valuable spy that ever
existed, waited patiently for the ray that would be generated inside
the Embassy to strike his head. In a few seconds, he would know even
more than he already did.

He smiled happily. This was the life!
