around the stove. Among them was Long John, and he singled him out and
told him his queer story. To Tommy’s surprise he burst into raucous
laughter.

“Hey, Fat! Hey, guys! Listen to this, will ya! This bird goes up the
road to the café that’s out of bounds, and when the M.P. comes in he
asks him to have a drink.”

Chorus--

“Yeah?”

“Yeah. And then he wonders why the M.P. don’t buy him one.”

“No!”

“Fact, and then the M.P. tells him to buy another one, and he does!”

“Yeah?”

“And then the officer of the day drives up, and the M.P. tells him
there’s nobody in there, and they ride off, and now this bird wants to
know what it’s all about!”

A howl of glee went up, and from that moment Tommy became a marked man
at Issy-la-Boue, as he had a habit of doing everywhere he went.

A bugle blew at this juncture and all the flying officers rushed to
their bunks and seized peculiar looking instruments with which they went
outside. Still wondering, Tommy followed them.
