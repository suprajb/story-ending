The ordnance sergeant, Jake Lavender, looked up from the Sharps carbine
he was repairing. "Huh?"

There was no reply.

Frowning he took an oily rag and began wiping the bolt he had filed
into a better fit. Sure as thunder someone had called out the captain's
name. Or whispered it, more like. His gaze darted about the littered
barn loft--boxes of ammunition, two saddles, piles of stolen rifles and
an empty bunk. No room for anyone to hide.

Sergeant Lavender vigorously renewed his wiping.

"By God!" He snatched up a loaded pistol and rose. That voice had been
as close as his skin. "Show yourself," he bawled.

At the far end of the loft a door creaked open and a short slender
man, pistol in each hand, came out blinking sleepily. "What in blazes
is the matter with you, Jake?"

"Somebody called you, Captain. I could'a sworn it! Somebody right
here." He indicated the room with a nervous wave of his pistol. "Used
all three of your names too. Like whisperin', it was. Captain, sir--you
all right? Sir? _There!_--you hear 'em? A woman and a man, whisperin'
something about a daft sorta gun. Who is it, Captain? How are we
hearin' 'em?"

When the hackles rose just so high on Jake Lavender's neck he fainted.

His captain followed suit a few moments later.
