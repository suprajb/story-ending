When the first tug of intelligence registered, the Irritant was
sleeping restlessly. The second brought him out of troubled dreams. At
the third he hauled in. Nothing--nothing but a jumbled scattering of
low-order babble and memories and impressions. Not enough for a meal.

Angrily, he examined the trashy catch--three minor intelligence--mental
pictures of a crude something that stored, then propelled bits of
metal forward--and.... The Irritant took more careful note--A weave of
thoughts about some other intelligence called johnsingletonmosby. And
close at hand too. Just a few moves to the side, then around.

The Irritant patiently fashioned a new bait--a summary of the concepts
concerning the metallic object--the tube attached so to the middle
attached so to the rest, then filled with that which coiled and slid
and turned. Might be just the lure.

Done! Now ... the quarry should be about ... here!

Out went the bait into space-time.
