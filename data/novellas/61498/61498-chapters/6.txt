Who is the Wolf of Saturn? People on Titan will point out a blowzy,
sodden old derelict who hangs out in a dive near the skyport and tell
you that "Carmy," as they call him now, used to wear that title. He was
a big shot once, they say.

But if you should ask any of the frequenters of the big building
on lower Manhattan who the Wolf of Saturn is, they will tell you
instantly. It is a crackpot on Titan by the name of Kellog. He was the
fellow who ruthlessly and without warning wrecked two of the biggest
and most profitable enterprises in the universe--Etherways, Inc., and
Interplanetary Transport--and many of the smartest financiers of the
System with it. What a guy! Not only that, but he wrecked the System's
entire price structure with his cheap services. "Benefactor?" they will
squall. "He's a wild man--a wolf!"
