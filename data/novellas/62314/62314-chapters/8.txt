The fire had passed over the horizon. The air was blue with smoke,
difficult to breathe, and ashes were drifting lightly down like
dove-colored snow. Yasak, watery eyed, a cloth pressed to his nose, was
walking with several others over the smoking earth and still warm ashes
up to his knees. In one hand he held a stick. He stopped and pointed.
"He fell about here," he said, and began to probe the ashes with the
stick.

He struck something. "Here he is!" he cried. The others hurried to the
spot and scooped ashes away, dog-fashion, until Robert's remains were
laid clear. There were exclamations of amazement and perplexity from
the people.

It was a metal skeleton, and the fragments of complicated machinery,
caked with soot.

"He wasn't human at all!" Yasak marvelled. "He was some kind of a toy
made to look like a man--that's why he wore armor, and his face never
changed expression--"

"Magic!" someone cried, and backed away.

"Magic!" the others repeated, and edged back ... and that was the
end of one of those robots which had been fashioned as servants for
Terrestial men, made in Man's likeness to appease Man's vanity, then
conquered him.
