Eagerly, the Personnel Manager collated the records of the
Personnelovac. They were far more complex than any employee record, and
it took Colihan the better part of an hour.

Any moment he expected to hear the President's angry voice over the
inter-com. His anxiety made him fumble, but at last, the job was done.

He slipped the record, marked by a galaxy of pinholes, into the Brain.

"Now we'll see," he said grimly. "Now we'll find out what's eating this
monster."

He flipped the switch.

The Personnelovac winked.

It was several minutes before it digested the information in its
chamber. Then it chittered.

It chortled.

It chuckled.

Colihan held his breath until the BURP came.

The card appeared. It read:

"_Subject #PV8. Mech. Rat. 9987. Mem. Rat. 9995. Last Per. Vac._

"_An. None. Cur. Rat. 100._

"_Analysis: Subject operating at maximum efficiency. Equipped to perform
at peak level. Is completely honest and does not exhibit bias,
prejudice, or sentiment in establishing personnel evaluations.
Cumulative increase in mnemonic ability. Analytic ability improving._"

Colihan walked slowly over to the Action Chute as he finished reading
the card.

"_However_," it read, "_because of mechanistic approach to humanistic
evaluation, subject displays inability to incorporate human equation in
analytical computation, resulting in technically accurate but
humanistically incorrect deductions._

"_Recommendation: Fire him._"

Colihan dropped the pink card into the chute. In half an hour, the
Action wheels of General Products concluded their work, and the
Personnelovac had winked for the last time.
