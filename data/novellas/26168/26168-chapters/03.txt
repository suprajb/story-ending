Colihan's secretary placed the morning mail on his desk. There was a
stack of memos at least an inch thick, and the Personnel Manager moaned
at the sight of it.

"Production report doesn't look too good," said Miss Blanche, crisply.
"Bet we get a flood of aptitude cards from Morgan today. Grimswitch has
sent over a couple. That makes eleven from him this month. He really has
his problems."

Colihan grunted. _He deserves them_, he thought.

"How did the meeting go?"

"Huh?" Colihan looked up. "Oh, fine, fine. Boss was in good voice, as
usual."

"I think there's an envelope from him in the stack."

"What?" Colihan hoped that his concern wasn't visible. He riffled
through the papers hurriedly, and came up with a neat white envelope
engraved with the words: OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

Miss Blanche watched him, frankly curious. "That will be all," he told
her curtly.

When she had left, he ripped the envelope open and read the contents. It
was in Moss's own cramped handwriting, and it was a request for a three
