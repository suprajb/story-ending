When Miss Blanche announced that President Moss himself was in Colihan's
outer lobby, the Personnel Manager spent a hasty minute in straightening
up the paper debris on his desk.

The old man came striding into the room, exhibiting plenty of p-e-p, and
he seated himself briskly on Colihan's sofa.

"Sharp eyes, Ralph," he said. "Sharp eyes and a quick wit. This business
demands it. That was a sharp notion you had, doing a run-through on
Grimswitch. Never trusted that back-slapping fellow."

Colihan looked pleased. "Trying to do a job, sir."

"Put your finger on it," said Moss. "Hit the nail on the head. It's just
like my father said: 'Trees go dead on the top.' Colihan--" The boss
leaned forward confidentially. "I've got an assignment for you. Big
assignment."

"Yes, sir!" said Colihan eagerly.

"If Grimswitch is a sour apple, maybe _other_ department heads are, too.
And who knows? IT knows."

Moss pointed a finger at the Personnelovac.

"I'm rounding up all the aptitude records of the department heads.
They'll be in your hands in the next couple of days. Feed 'em in! Root
'em out! Spot the deadwood, Colihan! ACT!"

"ACT!" echoed Colihan, his face flushed.

The old man got up and went over to the Brain.

"Marvelous machine," he said. "Honest. That's what I like about it."

As Moss went out the door, Colihan could have sworn he saw the
Personnelovac wink. He walked over to it and fingered the lever. It was
turned off, all right.
