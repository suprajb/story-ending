It was an interesting week for Colihan.

Morgan, the production man, was fired.

Grimswitch came up to see the Personnel man and tried to punch him in
the nose. Fortunately, he was a little too drunk, and the blow went
wild.

Seegrum, the Shipovac operator, was fired.

Douglas, the Treasurer, was permitted to keep his job, but the
Personnelovac issued a dire threat if improvement wasn't rapidly
forthcoming.

Wilson, the firm's oldest employee, was fired.

In fact, seven out of General Product's twelve department heads were
greeted by the ominous pink card.

Colihan, no longer plagued by doubt, felt that life was definitely worth
living. He smiled all the time. His memos were snappier than ever. His
heels clicked merrily down the office hallways. He had p-e-p.

Then, the most obvious thing in the world happened--and Colihan just
hadn't foreseen it.

_His_ record card came up.
