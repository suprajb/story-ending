Colihan was getting worried. The boss's conversation was just a little
too folksy for his liking.

"Yes, sir, a mighty fine quality. My father used to say: 'Andrew, an
honest man can always look you in the eyes.'"

Colihan stared uncomprehendingly. He realized that Moss had stopped
talking, so he looked him squarely in the eyes and said: "He must have
been a fine man, your father."

"He was honest," said Moss. "I'll say that for him. He was honest as
they come. Did you ever hear of Dimaggio?"

"It sounds familiar--"

"It should. Dimaggio was a legendary figure. He took a lantern and went
out into the world looking for an honest man. And do you know
something? He couldn't find one. You know, Ralph, sometimes _I_ feel
like Dimaggio."

Colihan gulped.

"And do you know why? Because sometimes I see a thing like _this_--" the
boss's hand reached into the desk and came out with a thick bundle of
pink cards--"and I wonder if there's an honest man left in the world."
