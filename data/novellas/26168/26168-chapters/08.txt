Grimswitch followed Colihan down the hall as he came out of the boss's
office for the third time that week.

"Well!" he said fatuously. "Quite the teacher's pet, these days. Eh,
Colihan?"

"Go away, Grimswitch."

"On the carpet, eh? Temper a little short? Don't worry." Grimswitch's
beefy hand made unpleasant contact with the Personnel man's shoulder.
"Your old friends won't let you down."

"Grimswitch, will you please let me alone?"

"Better watch that think-machine of yours," Grimswitch chuckled. "Might
fire _you_ next, old boy."

Colihan was glad when Morgan, the production operator, hailed Grimswitch
away. But as he entered his own office, Grimswitch's words still
troubled him. _Grimswitch_, he thought. _That fat piece of garbage. That
big blow-hard. That know-it-all._

Almost savagely, he picked up the day's personnel cards and flipped
through them carelessly.

_Grimswitch, that louse_, he thought.

Then he had the Idea.

If Grimswitch was still chewing the fat with Morgan, then his secretary
would be alone--

If he called her and asked for Grimswitch's record--no, better yet, got
Miss Blanche to call--

_Why not?_ he thought. _After all, I am the Personnel Manager. Sure,
it's a little irregular. He IS a department head. But it's my job, isn't
it?_

Colihan flipped the inter-com and proceeded to call Miss Blanche.
