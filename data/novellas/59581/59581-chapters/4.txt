There would be little time, very little time. First, to see if the warp
shuttle was portable--

It was. When he unfastened the clamp that held it to the stand it
lifted up freely, trailing a heavy cable behind it. He saw it was only
a power supply cable, with a plug that would fit one of the sockets in
the bow of the ship. He left the shuttle floating in the air, leashed
by the cable, and went to the computer. Next, he would have to know if
Sirius would be fully in the ship--

He switched the computer on and typed:

DETERMINE THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OF THE WARP SHUTTLE'S FOCAL BALL
TO THE SPACE WARP POSITION OF SIRIUS AT 13:53, BASING YOUR COMPUTATIONS
ON THE EXPANDING-SHIP THEORY.

It gave him the answer a moment later: 18.3496 METERS.

He visualized the distance, from his knowledge of the ship's interior,
and saw the position would be within the forward spare-parts room.

Next, to learn exactly where in that room he should place the shuttle.
He could not do so by measuring from the present position of the
shuttle. The most precise steel tape would have to be at exactly the
right temperature for such a measurement to be neither too short nor
too long. He had no such tape, and the distance from the focal ball
was only part of the necessary measuring: he would have to measure
off a certain distance and a precisely certain angle from the purely
imaginary central line of the ship's axis to intersect the original
line. Such a measurement would be impossible in the time he had.

He considered what would be his last question to the computer. The
hand was touching the zero and his question would have to be worded
very clearly and subject to no misinterpretations. There would be no
follow-up questions permitted.

He began typing:

IT IS DESIRED THAT THIS SHIP EMERGE INTO NORMAL SPACE ONE LIGHT-HOUR
THIS SIDE OF SIRIUS AT 13:53. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MOVING
THE WARP SHUTTLE TO SUCH A POSITION THAT ITS FOCAL CENTER WILL BE IN
A SPACE WARP POSITION COINCIDING WITH A NORMAL SPACE POSITION ONE
LIGHT-HOUR THIS SIDE OF SIRIUS AT 13:53. CONSIDER ALL FACTORS THAT
MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS SHIP, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE
CHANGES PRODUCED BY OUR NORMAL SPACE ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION,
WHEN COMPUTING THE POSITION OF SIRIUS. THEN DEFINE THAT LOCATION IN
RELATION TO THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE ROOM'S INTERIOR. DO THIS
IN SUCH A MANNER THAT PLACING THE SHUTTLE IN THE PROPER POSITION WILL
REQUIRE THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF MEASURING DISTANCES AND ANGLES.

It seemed to take it an unduly long time to answer the question and he
waited restlessly, unpleasantly aware of the hand touching zero and
wondering if the computer's mind was baffled by the question; the mind
that thought best in terms of orderly mathematics and could not know
or care that measurement by protractor and tape would result in a
position fatally far from that described by the neat, rigid figures.

Then the answer appeared, beautifully concise:

POSITION WILL BE IN CORNER OF ROOM, 764.2 CENTIMETERS ABOVE FLOOR
PLATE, 820 CENTIMETERS PERPENDICULAR TO PANEL AA, 652.05 CENTIMETERS
PERPENDICULAR TO PANEL AB.

The computer died with an oddly human sigh. Its last act had been
to give him the location of Sirius in such a manner that he could
accurately position the shuttle's focal ball with the aid of the
precision measuring devices in the ship's repair room.

He went to the shuttle and picked it up in his arms. It was entirely
weightless, and each magnet-clicking step he took toward the bow of the
ship brought Sirius almost half a light-year nearer.
