A myriad of lights above the board informed him the generators were
destroyed, the stern section riddled and airless, the emergency
batteries damaged and reduced to quarter charge, the shuttle room
punctured and airless.

And, of course, Harding and Garvin were dead.

He felt a surge of futile anger. It had all been unnecessary. If only
they had not considered him incompetent to be entrusted with anything
more than the ship's operation--if only they had installed an emergency
switch for the shuttle by his control board, there would not have been
the two-second delay following his order and they would have been
safely in the warp before the blaster beam struck.

But they had not trusted him with responsibility and now he was alone
in a space warp he did not understand; sole and full responsibility
for the shuttle suddenly in his hands.

He considered his course of action, then got into a pressure suit.
Magnets in the soles of its heavy boots permitted him to walk in
the absence of gravity and he went to the interroom airlock with
metallically clicking steps. He let himself through the lock and walked
down what had been the room's wall, then across to the center of its
floor.

But for the fact there was no one in the room, it was as he had last
seen it. The shuttle, computer, and other equipment stood in their
orderly positions with their lighted dials unchanged. Until one looked
at the gash ripped in the hull and saw the stains along its edge where
the occupants had been hurled through it by the escaping air.

He went on to the next room and the next. The damage increased as he
proceeded toward the stern. The power generators were sliced into
ribbons and the emergency batteries in such condition it seemed a
miracle they were functioning at all. The drives had received the
greatest damage; they were an unrecognizable mass of wreckage.

He made his way back to the shuttle room, there to appraise his
circumstances. He reached automatically for a cigarette and stopped
when his glove bumped the breast plate of his pressure suit.

First, he would have to make the shuttle room livable; get out of the
pressure suit. He would have to question the computer and he could not
do that with the thick, clumsy gloves on his hands.

The job didn't take long. There were repair plates on the ship and a
quick-hardening plastic spray. He closed the sternward airlock when he
was done and opened the airlock leading to the control room, as well
as the locks beyond. Air filled the shuttle room, with only a minor
over-all loss of air pressure. He removed the suit, attached a pair
of magnetic soles to his shoes so he could operate the keys of the
computer without the movements sending him floating away, and went to
it.

He had never been permitted to touch it before, nor even stand close
enough to see what the keyboard looked like. Now, he saw that the
alphabetical portion of the keyboard was minor compared with the
mathematical portion, many of the symbols strange to him.

The operation of an interplanetary ship required a certain knowledge of
mathematics, but not the kind used by theoretical physicists. He typed,
doubtfully:

ARE YOU CAPABLE OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS PRESENTED IN NON-MATHEMATICAL
FORM?

The word, YES, appeared at once in the answer panel and relief came to
him like the lifting of a heavy burden.

The computer knew as much about the space warp as Harding or anyone
else. It was connected with his drive controls and instruments and knew
how far, how fast, and in what directions the flight had taken place.
It had even been given blueprints of the ship's construction, in case
the structure of the ship should affect the ship's performance in the
warp, and knew every nut, bolt, plate and dimension in the ship.

There was supposed to be a certain method of procedure when questioning
the computer. "It knows--but it can't think," Garvin had once said. "It
lacks the initiative to correlate data and arrive at conclusions unless
the procedure of correlation is given it in detail."

Perhaps he could manage to outline some method of correlation for the
computer. The facts of his predicament were simple enough:

He was in an unknown medium called "the Space Warp." Something not
anticipated occurred when a ship went into the warp and Harding had
not yet solved the mystery when he died. The physicists in Observation
would be able to find the answer but he could not ask them. The
forward movement of the ship was not transferred with it into the warp
and if he emerged into normal space the waiting Slug cruisers would
disintegrate him before he spoke three words to Observation.

There was a pencil and a tablet of paper by the computer. He used
them to calculate the time at which the charge in the damaged
batteries would reach a critical low, beyond which the charge would be
insufficient to activate the shuttle.

The answer was 13:53. He would have to go out of the warp at 13:53 or
remain in it forever. He had a great deal less than two hours in which
to act.

He typed the first question to the computer:

WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THIS SHIP RELATIVE TO NORMAL SPACE?

The answer appeared on the panel at once; the coordinates of a position
more than a light-year toward Ophiuchus.

He stared at the answer, feeling it must be an error. But it could not
be an error--the computer did not make mistakes. How, then, could the
ship have traveled more than a light-year during its second stay in
the warp when it had not moved at all during the first stay? Had some
factor of the warp unknown to him entered the picture?

As a check he typed another question:

WHAT WAS OUR POSITION, RELATIVE TO NORMAL SPACE, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE
THIS SHIP WAS SHUTTLED BACK OUT OF THE WARP?

The answer was a position light-days toward Ophiuchus.

He typed: IMPOSSIBLE.

The computer replied: THIS STATEMENT CONFLICTS WITH PREVIOUS DATA.

He recalled the importance of keeping the computer free of all faulty
or obscure data and typed quickly: CANCEL CONFLICTING STATEMENT.

CONFLICTING STATEMENT CANCELED, it replied.

He tried another tack. THIS SHIP EMERGED FROM THE SPACE WARP INTO THE
SAME NORMAL SPACE POSITION IT HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE GOING INTO THE WARP.

He thought the computer would proceed to give him some sort of an
explanation. Instead, it non-committally replied: DATA ACKNOWLEDGED.

He typed: EXPLAIN THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SPACE WARP AND NORMAL SPACE
POSITIONS.

It answered: INSUFFICIENT DATA TO ACCOUNT FOR DISCREPANCY.

He asked, HOW DID YOU DETERMINE OUR PRESENT POSITION?

It replied: BY TRIANGULATION, BASED ON THE RECESSION OF EARTH, THE SUN,
SIRIUS, ORION, AND OTHER STARS.

BUT THE RECEDING SUN WENT INTO THE ULTRAVIOLET, he objected.

Again it answered with the non-commital, DATA ACKNOWLEDGED.

DID YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS DATA? he asked.

YES.

EXPLAIN WHY THE RECEDING SUN SHIFTED INTO THE ULTRAVIOLET INSTEAD OF
THE INFRARED.

It replied: DATA INSUFFICIENT TO ARRIVE AT LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

He paused, pondering his next move. Time was speeding by and he was
learning nothing of value. He would have to move the ship to some
place in the warp where emergence into normal space would not put him
under the blasters of the Slug cruisers. He could not know where to
move the ship until he knew where the ship was at the present. He did
not believe it was in the position given him by the computer, and its
original space warp position had certainly not been the one given by
the computer.

The computer did not have the ability to use its knowledge to explain
contradictory data. It had been ordered to compute their space warp
position by triangulation of the receding sun and stars and was not
at all disturbed by the contradicting shift of the sun into the
ultraviolet. Suppose it had been ordered to calculate their position by
computations based on the shift of the sun's and stars' spectrum into
the ultraviolet?

He asked it: WHAT IS OUR POSITION, IGNORING THE TRIANGULATION AND
BASING YOUR COMPUTATIONS ON THE SHIFT OF THE SPECTRUMS OF THE SUN AND
ORION INTO THE ULTRAVIOLET?

It gave him the coordinates of a position almost two light-years
toward Orion. The triangulation computations had shown the ship to be
going backward at many times the speed of light; the spectrum-shift
computations showed it to be going forward with approximately the same
speed.

THIS SHIP CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY BE IN TWO POSITIONS THREE LIGHT-YEARS
APART. NEITHER CAN IT SIMULTANEOUSLY BE GOING FORWARD AND BACKWARD.

DATA ACKNOWLEDGED, it agreed.

USE THAT DATA TO EXPLAIN THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE TWO POSITIONS YOU
COMPUTED.

DATA INSUFFICIENT TO ARRIVE AT LOGICAL EXPLANATION, it answered.

ARE YOU CERTAIN THERE WAS NO ERROR IN YOUR CALCULATIONS?

THERE WAS NO ERROR.

DO YOU KNOW THAT IF WE DROPPED BACK INTO NORMAL SPACE, IT WOULD BE AT
NEITHER OF THE POSITIONS YOU GAVE ME?

It replied with the characteristic single-mindedness: DATA SHOWS OUR
TWO POSITIONS TO BE THOSE GIVEN.

He paused again. He was still getting nowhere while time fled by. How
swiftly less than a hundred minutes could pass when they were all a
man had left to him....

The computer was a genius with the mental initiative of a moronic
child. It could find the answer for him but first he would have to take
it by the hand and lead it in the right direction. To do that he would
have to know more about the warp.

He wrote: EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE SPACE WARP AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE
AND WITHOUT USING MATHEMATICS HIGHER THAN ALGEBRA.

It answered at once: THIS CANNOT BE DONE.

The chronometer read 12:30. He typed:

THIS SHIP WILL HAVE TO RETURN TO NORMAL SPACE NO LATER THAN 13:53. IT
MUST BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT POSITION WHILE STILL IN THE WARP.

DATA ACKNOWLEDGED, it replied.

THIS SHIP CANNOT OCCUPY TWO POSITIONS AT THE SAME TIME. YOUR MEMORY
FILES SHOULD CONTAIN SUFFICIENT DATA TO ENABLE YOU TO FIND THE
EXPLANATION OF THIS TWO-POSITIONS PARADOX. FIND THAT EXPLANATION.

SUBMIT METHOD OF PROCEDURE, it answered.

I DO NOT KNOW HOW. YOU WILL HAVE TO ARRIVE AT THE EXPLANATION UNAIDED.

THIS CANNOT BE DONE, it replied.

He wrote, with morbid curiosity:

IF YOU DO NOT FIND THE ANSWER UNAIDED YOU WILL BE DESTROYED ALONG WITH
ME AT 13:53. DON'T YOU GIVE A DAMN?

It answered: GIVE A DAMN IS A SEMANTIC EXPRESSION I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
CLARIFY QUESTION.

He got out of the computer seat and walked about the room restlessly.
He passed by the transdimensional viewscreen and communicator and
pressed the communicator's signal button. A dial flickered in return,
showing his signal was going out, but there was no sound in response.
If only he could make contact with the brains in Observation--

He was umpty billion miles east of the sun and umpty billion miles west
of the sun. He was racing faster than light in two different directions
at once and he was sitting motionless under the blasters of two Slug
cruisers.

Another thought came to him: even if he could move the ship while in
the warp, where could he go?

He would have to go far beyond the outer limits of the solar system to
escape detection by the Slug cruisers. And at that distance the sun
would be only a yellow star, incapable of energizing the little solar
power units. He would not live long after the last of the power was
drained from the batteries and the air regeneration equipment ceased
functioning. He would not even dare sleep, toward the last. There were
no convection currents in the air of a ship without gravity, and it was
imperative that the air be circulated constantly. The air circulation
blowers would cease functioning while the ship still contained pure air
but he would have to move about continually to breathe that air. Should
he lie down to sleep he would smother to death in a carbon dioxide
bubble of his own making.

If he managed to emerge into normal space at some point just outside
Earth's atmosphere, beyond range of the cruisers, his driveless ship
would descend as a blazing meteor. If, by some miracle, he could
emerge into normal space just a few inches above the space-field it
would be to materialize into space already occupied by air. Such
a materialization would be simultaneously fatal to him and to the
electronic components of the shuttle and computer.

And if he did not move the ship, the Slug cruisers would disintegrate
him. He had four hypothetical choices of his way to die, all equally
unpleasant.

He smiled wanly at his reflection in the bright metal bordering the
viewscreen and said, "Brother--you've had it!"
