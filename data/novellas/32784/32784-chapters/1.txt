The evacuation under way, the great ships lanced upward, one after
another. One every three seconds, for a month of earth time. And deep in
the water of her subterranean abode, it seemed to one great heart that
with each blast of sound as another great ship lifted, some weight
lifted from her heart.

The people of the Dark Goddess leaving their ancient home were very
numerous, and very sad. But few of them thought twice of their ancient
benefactress who had welcomed their ancestors, taught them, started them
abuilding in the rock their vast cavern homes. If she wished to remain
and die, that was her affair. She was not human. She was only a bit of
ancient history that had somehow remained alive.

All of the people of the dark planet of ice were included in that
migration. Not one remained to face death with their ancient Goddess.
The dark planet moved on into its new orbit, empty of life. Empty, that
is, except for one dark lonely heart. The mer-creature was too vast of
body for any ship to hold. Besides, she breathed water--and she did not
want to go. That was very strange. Very strange indeed. Of all that
myriad of departing voyagers, not one understood why their Dark Goddess
did not wish to go along. Which perhaps explains the mystery.
