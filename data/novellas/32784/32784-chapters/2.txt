An age passed. Or was it but a few years, a hundred or so? The mer-woman
did not count the years. The once free planet now circled the angry red
sun as a humble captive. On its now warm surface soil formed and plants
grew. Trees and animals began to move about, grow larger. It was a new
wild jungle planet, untouched by organized intelligence of any kind.

Deep down in the dim caverns, in her deepest lair, the mistress of an
age of magic slept, and waked, and slept again. And what she thought
about, and what she waited for, and what she did with the endless time
on her hands, were mysteries. Mysteries, at times, even to herself. But
her heart was sometimes very light, and glad to be alone, and at other
times, very sad, and very sure that mankind itself was not what she
would wish it to be. In searching her heart, Alfreya knew she was very
well rid of all that clutter in the caverns overhead.
