The Azures did accept Aedo all right. They seem to think he must have
come from some other tribe. They don't associate him with the Indigo
that disappeared. No Indigo ever became an Azure before.

Of course, Azures sometimes become Indigos, we found out.

It seems there's a virus of what Ellik called pseudo-cyanosis in the
air. The Azures have become a pretty resistant breed to it, while the
Indigos are all easy victims. But once in a while an Azure will come
down with it and turn Indigo.

Mike Ellik caught it too.

It happened pretty fast. By the time we realized what it was, he was
already too stupid to finish the operation he started on himself. I had
to sew him up, not very neatly.

Ellik is treated pretty much like the rest of the Indigos. So am I. He
takes it all pretty calm. He can still talk a little Earth. Whenever
anybody kicks him, Ellik just mutters something about, "What can fellow
expect bunch lousy creeps like those fellow?"

I guess I'll get it too. I think I am getting it.

It won't be so bad for me. Just like maybe going around drunk all the
time, not being able to think or coordinate very well.

It will be kind of bad being a member of an inferior race, but the
thing I'll hate about it the most isn't that, or even leaving old Lee
up there, circling around and waiting for our call forever.

No, the thing I hate is having it happen _now_, just when I'm beginning
to _learn_ something.

I'm not dead sure I know just exactly what I learned, but I think maybe
I do:

You get just what you damned well expected all along from a bunch of
blue-blooded mongrels!
