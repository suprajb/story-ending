Mike Ellik said, "It's an inept analogy, Lee, and you know it."

"But most people reason by analogy," said Lee Chon. "No, Mike. I have
to leave you and Johnny to prevent a recurrence of racial hatred,
intolerance and all the ugly consequences on both sides. This is the
last time I'll answer you, Mike. I'm getting lonesome. In a few years,
I'll get hungry for human companionship. I don't want to be tempted
down. Good-by, Johnny. So long, Mike."

Ellik screamed. "Wait! Answer one more call, Lee. It's the least you
can do for me. I don't know when I'll make it. It may be in a few weeks
or a few years. It won't be just argument, Lee. I'll have something
you'll _want_ to tell Earth about this place and these people."

"I'm still here. Tell it to me now," Chon's voice said.

"No. I want to get proof. Let me rig up some kind of video circuit for
you. I can use parts out of our tape camera and the translators. I want
to get it all across to you."

I could hear Chon breathing. "Very well. I'll answer your next call."

"Lee," I called out, "Mike and me will be expecting you to answer."

Chon laughed. "I'm not going anywhere, Johnny. Only around this world
every couple of hours."

"You couldn't make the jump through hyperspace without us, Lee," Ellik
said.

"That's right, Mike. I'm--I'm sorry to quarantine you two down there."

"_Quarantine!_" Ellik stormed. "_We're_ not sick, Lee. _You_ are the
sick one!"

There wasn't any sound, not even of breathing.

"You have an idea to change Lee's mind, Mike?" I asked.

He cupped his hand on the back of my neck. "Affirmative, Jonathan. A
pretty damned good one, too."

Ellik stood staring out the door, gnawing on one of his knuckles,
letting the sun turn the front of him into gold, so he looked like half
a statue, and half a man.

"I suppose it had to come out in him sooner or later," he said.

"What, Mike?"

"What could we expect? It's the basic quality of treachery in the
Oriental mind."
