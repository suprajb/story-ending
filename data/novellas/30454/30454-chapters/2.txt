Stark rose as they left. For a brief moment, he thought he had detected
a sense of rebellion in their attitude. But that was not possible.

The new law provided equality for all. And his department had been
created to iron out relations between the two races--excepting
complaints originated by troublemakers for the purpose of weakening the
New System. In such cases, Investigations had stepped in and the Martian
or Earthling troublemaker had been sent to the rare-earth mines.

The reddish light filtering in through the quartz and lead wall of his
office showed that it was almost time for the last bell.

On the street below, shoppers were streaming out of the stores on their
way to the various housing perimeters.

Earthlings were climbing into their speedy little jet cars for the short
trip to the recently modernized inner perimeters. Martians were waiting
for the slower auto buses. The traffic problem had been solved, under
the New System, by restricting the use of the Martian-built jet cars to
persons living in the inner perimeters.

As Stark watched, a black jet car impatiently hurtled out of the line of
traffic, bowled through a crowd of Martians waiting for an auto bus, and
skidded to a stop at the curb in front of the building.

A tall girl got out. The red evening glow reflecting from her golden
hair, made her breathing globe almost amber. Male Martians and
Earthlings alike turned to stare in appreciation as she pushed her way
through the crowd to the building's compressor lock. Carol was that kind
of girl.
