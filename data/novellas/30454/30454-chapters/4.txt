And suddenly she wasn't teasing any more. She put her arms around him.
"Dad and my brother would say I'm crazy. But all I want, Johnny, is you.
Just you! You know that."

Stark had picked out her birthday present, but he wanted it to be a
surprise for that night. He said, "I already saw one of your presents. A
black jet car!"

"How did you know that?"

"I saw you drive up in it a few minutes ago."

Carol giggled. "Dad gave it to me. Did you see me plow through that
crowd waiting for the auto bus?"

"Did your brother send you anything?"

She nodded. "Three new outfits from Earth. They were on the same liner
that brought the inspection team to the Settlement this morning. Oh,
yes, and the captain of the liner brought me this."

She showed him the tiny pin she wore attached to her collar. The pin
itself was a carefully wrought but cruel caricature of an awkward
buglike creature. A small ruby set in the center of its face served as
its eye.

Stark frowned. "Carol, you shouldn't be wearing that." He reached up and
unpinned it. "That's the sort of thing our department is fighting."

"But the captain said it was the latest rage back on Earth. They're even
making toys like it. I'm sure they're not designed to ... to poke fun at
anyone."

Stark started to say something, but the last bell interrupted him. He
said, "If you're going to take your father home and tell him about us
before the dinner, you'd better hurry. I'll come early."

Carol kissed him and said good-by. She left the pin on Stark's desk and
was smiling at him as she closed the door.
