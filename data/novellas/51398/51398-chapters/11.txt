Before he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the
communicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment,
then returned and read the message on the tape:

    STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM YOU.

    IN MEANTIME, GIVE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOLLOWING.

    WE KNOW THAT THE SYMBIOTES MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN
    THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SEAL-PEOPLE. THERE IS EVERY PROBABILITY THAT
    YOURS WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU--TO BETTER FIT YOUR BODY
    TO ITS PRESENT ENVIRONMENT.

    THE DANGER, WHICH WE HESITATED TO MENTION UNTIL NOW--WHEN YOU HAVE
    FORCED US BY YOUR OBSTINATE SILENCE--IS THAT IT CAN ALTER YOUR
    MIND ALSO. YOUR REPORT ON SECOND TRIBE OF SEAL-PEOPLE STRONGLY
    INDICATES THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING. THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT
    MORE INTELLIGENT AND HUMANLIKE THAN THE OTHERS. ON THE CONTRARY,
    YOU ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THEM.

    DANGER ACUTE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY. REPEAT: IMMEDIATELY!

    SS II

Kaiser picked up a large rock and slowly, methodically pounded the
communicator into a flattened jumble of metal and loose parts.

When he finished, he returned to the waiting girl on the river bank.
She pointed at his plastic trousers and made laughing sounds in her
throat. Kaiser returned the laugh and stripped off the trousers. They
ran, still laughing, into the water.

Already the long pink hair that had been growing on his body during the
past week was beginning to turn brown at the roots.
