Moving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment
through and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator,
as he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped
place on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.

Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine
casing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried
again, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The
metal beneath yielded slightly--but he felt the palms of his hands
bruise against the lever.

Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted.
His hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased
tremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried
again. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly--until the fuel pump
hung free!

Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution
rest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its
anticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.

He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to
read the two messages waiting for him.

The first was quite routine:

    REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL
    WEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME
    MOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST
    BE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID.

    TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME
    ADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE
    SYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH
    SYMBIOTES' AID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE.
    WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED.

    GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES.

    SS II

The second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note
of uneasiness in it.

    SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT.
    INFORMATION ON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.

    SS II

Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had
covered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to
sleep.

In the morning, another message was waiting:

    VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS
    QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.

    SS II
