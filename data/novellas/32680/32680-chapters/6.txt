Now, lookahere, son, it's no cause for you to go calling me a liar
just because you never heard of Stellar Electric and Fremont ain't
listed on any map you've got. You didn't expect me to stay behind when
everybody else had left, did you? I always had a hankerin' for a
different type of world, too.

A world where a body didn't have to work so blamed hard and total
strangers would be willin' to listen to my stories and buy me a
beer....


...THE END
