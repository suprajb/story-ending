He hardly "heard" her. "I don't understand it," he said. "With such
a high incidence of arrowway fatalities, and with so many bequeathed
brains to choose from, why should the Company have chosen a woman's?"

"You're overlooking the fact," she pointed out, "that in the majority
of arrowway fatalities, the brain itself is in some way damaged, and
you're overlooking the additional fact that ninety percent of the
brains that have been bequeathed to the Company are intellectually
and vocationally unsuited for symbiosis. I happened to be a qualified
engineer, and apparently I possessed the requisite intelligence. In any
event, I qualified, and here I am."

"How old were you when you were killed?" he asked her.

"Twenty-four. And you?"

"I was twenty-six. The way I went in for arrowway travel, it was a
wonder I lasted that long." He was thoughtful for a moment. Then, "I
wonder if we got ourselves killed deliberately."

"Probably. Most arrowway drivers do. And yet we hunger after
immortality. It's a paradox, isn't it?"

He realized to his surprise that he rather liked her. "What will you do
after the base is completed?" he asked.

"Help you build the next."

"The whole project will be abandoned if we don't show results on this
one--did they tell you that?"

"Yes, they told me. As the first M.A.N. and W.O.M.A.N., we're Gorman
and Oder Developments' last hope. If we fail, the Earth Government will
break the contract. But we won't fail, will we?"

Abruptly he visualized the face of a pretty, blue-eyed girl, and he
knew somehow that it was her face--the face she had had in the land
that had given her birth. "No," he said, "of course we won't fail. Come
with me, and I'll show you what I've completed so far."
