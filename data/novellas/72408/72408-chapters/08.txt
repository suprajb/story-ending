Late that afternoon, when he was charging EV for the third time
that day, the Boa 9 put in an appearance. 8M picked it up on his
transperipheral beam long before it reached the immediate vicinity, but
he did not cease operations, and he was still hard at work when the big
yellow machine descended the nearest hill.

It stopped in its tracks. The charge completed, 8M turned. "This is
Company property," he said. "I advise you leave immediately."

"This is anybody's property," the thought came, "and it will remain
anybody's property until such time as a practical base is established.
At the moment, you're a long ways from establishing anything of the
kind." And then, unexpectedly, "What were the two of you doing a minute
ago?"

"Working," 8M said. "What did you think we were doing?"

For a while the Boa 9 didn't say anything, and 8M got the impression
that it--or, more accurately, the orbiting controller--was deep in
thought. When it finally did speak, it addressed EV. "How beautiful are
thy feet with treads, O prince's daughter!" it said, and turned and
rolled away.

8M stared after it till it faded from his transperipheral vision. "What
did it mean?" he asked.

"I'm--I'm not sure," EV said. And then. "Had--hadn't we better get back
to work?"

They resumed operations, and got out two more heats prior to night
fall. As before, he charged her before they went to sleep so that a
heat would be ready first thing in the morning. She moved in very close
to him, and the awareness of her was almost more than he could bear.
