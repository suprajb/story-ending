It was the following morning, and the tracto-car was speeding smoothly
down Canal Grand. In the driver's seat sat Jimmy Starr, a bandage on
his temple, a smile on his face.

Beside him was Linda Hall, and in the rear tonneau Phil Hanley held a
heat gun to cover the bound figure of Hamilton Garth.

"We did it," Jimmy said at length. "The figurine cache is destroyed
forever."

The girl nodded.

"And the canal project won't be abandoned either," Jimmy continued.
"That explosion opened up a shaft leading to a still lower crypt where
there's enough pure _pxar_ ingots stored to build all the canal locks
the engineers need. Pure _pxar_. Not the figurine kind."

Linda nodded again.

"What I want to know is this," she said. "I know that that tube
you threw into the vault didn't go off the first time because the
detonator-cap didn't hit. But what kind of explosive is setro-frenalot?
I never heard of it.

"Neither did I," Jimmy laughed. "It goes back to the juke box age of
the twentieth century. In other words, double talk."
