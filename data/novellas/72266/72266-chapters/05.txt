But all that had been long ago. Since then the world had whirled around
the sun nearly seven hundred million times. Sixty-two great mountain
chains had risen, to end as barren plains. Seventy huge fields of ice
had covered him before retreating to their boreal home. Ocean islands
had risen from the sea, had fallen beneath the waves, forgotten in
eternity. Somewhere a tiny cell formed, moving in brackish waters,
dividing. He studied the phenomenon, excited because the single cell

body drifted across the floor of a warm sea. Growing tired of watching

"Ixmal! Ixmal!" The cry came out of the past, out of the silence of
hundreds of millions of years--a cry heavy with reproach. Yes, it was
the Man--the Man he had been fond of. He shuddered, struggling to
wakefulness.

"Sleep, sleep," Psychband soothed.

"The Man! The Man!" Ixmal cried in terror.

"No, Ixmal, the Man is dust. Sleep, sleep...." Yea, the Man was dust,
his very molecules scattered over the face of the earth. He, alone,
remained. He was supreme. Ixmal slept. And eons fled.
