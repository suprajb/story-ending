The teleo-electronic man stood in his mechanical coldness. "Perhaps
they made a mistake when they constructed me. My mind is much more
delicate, sensitive and human than they intended it should be. I think.
But it seems to be much too late to rectify the error. I'm human. I
deserve the same considerations as a human, as you. I'm even more
deserving of the relaxation and beautiful dreams of the Sleep than
you because I've served in the indescribable monotony of mechanical
servitude for so long. So, I've definitely decided. You'll take my
place."

Amco felt frustrated at the teleo-electronic man's logic. His longings
warped his own logic. "You were designed for this duty. I'd be
vulnerable to fatigue, sickness, death, whereas you--"

The teleo-electronic man started moving toward Amco. "No. I'm
going to make an electronic body for your brain--a body of
eternity like mine. I'll construct this body according to your
specifications--superficially that is."

Amco backed away.

"Don't make it difficult," radiated the robot. "You can't avoid the
inevitable."
