"Of course, you can't remember, Amco," the Coordinator said. "We
foresaw that. It's one of the paradoxes of time travel. But now
comprehending its principle, I anticipated illogical results in its
effects. I thought, or rather hoped, you would remember."

Amco shrugged. "There is some kind of vague, indistinct memory in
my mind. I'm convinced of that. But--I can't grasp it. Wherever my
discoveries are, they are important to us. They would have answered our
problem and given us a definite course of action."

The Coordinator turned. "We still have a problem at least to work on.
That's more than we had before. New worlds must be devised for the
senses and the mind. This one is about exhausted."

Amco nodded. "Meanwhile," he said, "I'll try constantly to recall what
I discovered in the future. Surely some sensory impression was made."

Amco isolated himself in laboratory and worked in exhaustive
auto-psycheometry. And after many centuries succeeded in uncovering
the buried memory. The date of his self destruction, through the
teleo-electronic man, was Arnim 500 A.S.
