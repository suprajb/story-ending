Amco finally managed to say, "No reason, logically. Why go on living
without an ultimate goal?" His voice bore a note of resignation, but
his eyes hinted at the anxiety he felt.

"That, then, is our problem," enthused the Coordinator. "Is a worthy
cause for continued Dhomastrial life determinable? If not, I'll envelop
Dhoma in the vibratory blasts that destroyed the invaders of 9400." He
paused, then added, thoughtfully, "Perhaps that will be the logical end
of it."

Amco revealed what had occurred to him when the Coordinator first
mentioned the crisis. He said: "The space-time converter. That is an
answer. We could go into the plegarthic time flow called the future and
find out."

The Coordinator nodded. "I can think of no other way. Even if it is
unsatisfactory. Though it's been proven that the space-time converter
operates satisfactorily no rationale has ever been reached as to _how_
it functions. The converter is illogical."

Amco nodded, too. "It is that. Perhaps it's been wise, restricting the
converter. But I see no other way."

"You agree then to make the attempt, Amco? You are the only one I
could trust. I know of no one else who still retains adequate sense of
responsibility."

"Of course," Amco was saying, his heart pounding abnormally, and his
face flushed.

"Thank you, Amco. I put the future of Dhoma in your hands then. Any
questions?"

"One," said Amco. "What if my findings are negative? You are definitely
determined to destroy all Dhomastrial life?"

"Yes, Amco."

Amco shrugged. He watched the three-dim screen fade.
