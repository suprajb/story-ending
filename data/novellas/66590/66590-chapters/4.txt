I was trying to stick my fingers down his throat when Rosemary
appeared. "He won't die," she said. "But I wouldn't advise eating those
clams. Nearly all of the fish are poisonous. He'll be all right in a
few minutes."

"What are we going to eat?" I asked. "Not that we're starving, but the
supply of food on our spaceship won't last forever."

"I have a garden," said Rosemary, "and I've domesticated some
livestock."

"My--uh--dear," said Clive, between groans. "I appoint you Secretary of
Agriculture."

"Let's get some things straight," said Rosemary. "This planet is not
going to be like the earth."

"But a democracy, my dear--"

"Okay, it's a democracy. I'm not opposed to freedom of government, but
there are a lot of things outside government that need changing. Back
on earth, man is the dominant sex. On this planet, woman will be."

"But there are two men, only one woman," Clive said. He was breathing a
little easier now and I judged he was recovering.

"All the more reason why woman should be dominant," said Rosemary. "I'm
more valuable."

"We're stronger. Women must have men to protect them."

"Any time you want to test your theory that you're stronger than I am,
I'm willing," said Rosemary. And she looked perfectly able to take care
of herself. I didn't know then how long she had been on the planet,
but she was hard as a rock. She'd taken care of herself in all kinds
of weather, done everything a man could do in fighting against nature.
Being a spaceman is no way to develop your biceps and neither is being
a senator.

"Hmm," said Clive. "Perhaps there should be more equality between
the sexes. But most of the things that women misinterpret are not
discrimination, but adoration."

"I don't care what it was," said Rosemary, "and I didn't say anything
about equality. Starting tomorrow, you boys will do what I tell you
to."

"But I'm the President!" Clive protested.

"And I'm the boss," said Rosemary.
