When we landed on Earth, we divided the spoils three ways because
Rosemary decided not to take either of us.

"Neither of you asked me to choose between you," she said, "and that
was the way to decide. You should have said: 'Take one of us and
the other will abide by your decision.' That is what is known as
compromise, even if it doesn't seem that way. The trouble with men is
that few of them can lose gracefully. They've got to start a war rather
than a compromise."

"But losing isn't compromising," I pointed out. "If you give up
something and gain something, that's a compromise."

"How do you know you haven't gained by losing me," she said.

I often wonder which of us she preferred back on Problem Planet. But
considering the fact that we were probably the first men she got to
know after her father died, I think she made a wise choice. Clive
married a woman lawyer, and I married a chorus girl.

Rosemary? She married a wrestler that could throw her.
