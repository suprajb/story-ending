Finally the bridge was in sight; then overhead. The running man pointed
up. Beyond the bridge, the glasslike covering ended.

Regan was out of the tunnel.

The river widened now and its velocity eased. But the current was still
a powerful one. Regan pointed the rocket tube so that it thrust him
upward. His rubber- and steel-clothed head broke the surface. He felt a
surge of freedom.

In his joy, Regan lost control of the rocket-brake and was twisted
crazily about. Instinctively he shut off the power; he was swept ahead.
As the river whirled him forward, he saw the man on the bank point
ahead to the right, wave him on and gesture that he would catch up
later.

It was with relief that Regan let himself be carried forward by the
strong current. He was traveling out of the mainstream now. In a few
minutes, the river was so broad that he seemed to be barely moving, but
this was merely an illusion of contrast.

Then Regan saw the mesh fence. It was a giant strainer across the
river, apparently fashioned to prevent debris from being carried into
the structure which straddled the river beyond--without doubt the
hydroelectric plant whose existence he had dreaded.

Regan was swept into the fence. It gave, cushioning the shock, and he
pulled himself along it toward the bank. He reached it but lacked the
strength to pull himself onto land.

Nearby, hugging the huge mesh fence, was the cask which had passed him
back in the dark of the tunnel.

Just as Regan was passing out, he saw the stocky man in the knee-length
shorts come into sight, running as fast as he could make his legs pump.
