Regan looked up. He grinned and set the empty glass upright on the
bar. "I've had a lot of time to think about it. They're awfully nice
people, all of them. I could have had a wonderful time if I'd been
able to climb out of that damn spacesuit. In time, I could even have
communicated with them passably well. Good-looking women, too."

He looked at me speculatively. He opened his mouth as if to speak
again, then smiled and shook his head.

I said it for him: "You're going back."

"Yes," he answered. "Yes, I'm going back. I know the coordinates of the
entrance to the passageway and its dimensions and the kind of equipment
I'll need. Nothing elaborate. In another year or so, I'll have enough
saved up, I think. Get myself a little space launch; one of the smaller
ones, lifeboat size. Fit it out with food and water--and some picture
books, of course, to show them what it's like where I come from. I'd
take somebody along with me if I could find anyone who wanted to
go--and who believed me."

"I believe you," I said. "But--"

"Sure. You'd be crazy to go. Wife and kids. I've got none of that.
Mostly what I want to do, I guess, is prove those longbeards upstairs
are cockeyed."

"I hope you do. Maybe you'll let me write about it when you get back."

"It'll be a good story," Regan assured me.

"I'll be waiting for it," I promised.

That was five years ago. Four years ago, Regan went, as he said he
would. He went alone, in a little space launch.

I'm still waiting to write the end of the story.
