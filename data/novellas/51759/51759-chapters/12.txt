Regan knew he was in a hospital even before he opened his eyes. The
ether-and-disinfectant smell told him that.

It was taking an effort to thrust his eyelids up. He moved his arms
and felt them close to his body. He raised one hand to his face and
rubbed his closed eyes. Of course they'd have got him out of the
spacesuit.

He opened his eyes.

A brown-faced man was leaning over the bed. He was wearing a white
smock and had a fountain pen in the breast pocket. Beyond the man--the
doctor--there was a window. A perfectly ordinary window, through which
Regan could see the sky. A blue sky with white clouds in it.

The doctor smiled at Regan and said in English: "How do you feel, son?"

Regan tried to speak but couldn't.

"This is Bombay," the doctor said. "Bombay, in India. It must be quite
a surprise to you, but I'm glad to say you'll be all right."

"What?" Regan asked vaguely.

"It's strange, of course," said the doctor. "You should be on the other
side of the world, by all that's natural. We communicated with the
American authorities when we saw your identification. It is extremely
odd. Still, here you are, and you will be well. Quite soon, too."

"But--" Regan began. Then he gave up. He said nothing more until after
he'd eaten and slept and the doctor asked him if he felt strong enough
now to see the reporters.
