Now I am well versed in the lore of the sea in all ages. Through mists
of time I have enviously eyed wild voyagings of sea rovers who roved
and spun their yarns before the stronger sex came into its own, and
ousted man from his heroic pedestal. I have followed--across the
printed page--the wanderings of Odysseus. Before Gulliver I have
burned the incense of tranced attention; and with reverent awe
considered the history of one Munchausen, a baron. But alas, these
were only men!

In what field is not woman our subtle superior?

Meekly I bowed my head, and when my eyes dared lift again, the ancient
mariness had departed, leaving me to sorrow for my surpassed and
outdone idols. Also with a bill for macaroons and tea of such
incredible proportions that in comparison therewith I found it easy to
believe her story!
