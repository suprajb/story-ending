George looked at the man in the chair in amazement. Was that the way he
had sounded? Somehow, through the hearing aid, his own voice had seemed
louder, less faltering.

"Only too happy to do it, sir," George said. "The pleasure was all
mine." He wanted to add that Sandane was acting his part superbly, but
didn't know just how to say it before Edna.

"We could give you a lift to your hotel," Edna suggested.

"Thank you, madam, but I don't believe I shall check into a hotel as
yet. I shall leave my bags here until later in the evening." George was
surprised how quickly he had assumed the manner of speaking that went
with his clothes.

"Well, take a couple of drinks for me," the old voice interjected. "Say
hello to them pretty girls for me, too. So long, Sandy, and good luck."

"So long, George," George replied, his voice choking up with pity for
an old man who could not do what he wanted to do on this beautiful
evening, in this beautiful city.

When they had gone, he walked out of the station, enjoying every step
of the vigorous young legs, feeling every muscle of the vigorous
young body, glowing with life. Outside, he paused for a moment on the
sidewalk before calling a cab.

Two weeks, give or take a day or so, would be long enough to do the
town. And two thousand dollars, give or take twenty, would be enough to
do it on. The young-old man from elsewhen and the present was going to
have one hell of a good time.
