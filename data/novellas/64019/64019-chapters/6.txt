Above and behind him, the sun blazed hot and silent in the crawling
sky. He watched the slow revolution of the heavens above him,
fascinated, for a moment, stared as the great ball of the earth jumped
over the far boundary of the great metal field and began climbing up,
dragging its moon. He staggered. The flat side of the three mile cube
seemed to wobble and he realized that the attendant's warning had been
far from overcautious. A man might go mad out in this absolute silence,
bounded now by nothing but the great black wall of the universe and its
billions of pinholes. He closed his eyes, listening to the tick of his
wristwatch and then opened them suddenly, as he realized that the watch
was gone.

He remembered how close she'd been, how neatly she'd fallen against
him, pinching him with one hand, while, with the other she slipped the
simple catch of the watchband and palmed it. And he'd never noticed.

Firelie Gluck. He laughed.

Ironically he saluted the climbing blue globe of the Earth. They would
wait another time now, another try. But he would not sacrifice his own
money. He had spent $25,000 for a job well done, and, of course, the
only way to do it right was to do it himself.

The glass of the faceplate was too thick for even a steel-mailed fist
to smash. Condemeign walked to a garbage disposal tube that projected
a few feet out off the level surface of the cube side. The champagne
and the other drink were wearing off. The steel plates bucked under
his feet and he knew that in another minute he'd be retching, with
the majestic background for a perfectly dramatic exit cut off by a
spew of vomit. Kneeling, he brought the faceplate of the helmet down
with a sharp crack on the steel projection. The glass shattered with
a gay burst and just for a second he heard the awful silence of the
imponderable ether.
