Blake said, "I don't want to know what you mean. Get to the natives and
the earrings."

I said, "But of course with animals like that, you never _know_ whether
they're dangerous until you've been around them for a while. You can't
judge by size or looks. Like if you'd never seen a snake, you'd never
guess that a little coral snake was dangerous, would you? And a Martian
zeezee looks for all the world like an overgrown guinea-pig. But
without a gun--or with one, for that matter--I'd rather face a grizzly
bear or a--"

"The earrings," said Blake. "You were talking about earrings."

I said, "Oh, yes; earrings. Well, the natives wore them--for now, I'll
put it that way, to make it easier to tell. One earring apiece, even
though they had two ears. Gave them a sort of lopsided look, because
they were pretty fair-sized earrings--like hoops of plain gold, two or
three inches in diameter.

"Anyway, the tribe we landed near wore them that way. We could see the
village--a very primitive sort of place made of mud huts--from where
we landed. We had a council of war and decided that three of us would
stay in the ship and the other three go to the village. Lecky, the
biologist, and Art Willis and I with guns. We didn't know what we might
run into, see? And Lecky was chosen because he was pretty much of a
linguist. He had a flair for languages and could talk them almost as
soon as he heard them.
