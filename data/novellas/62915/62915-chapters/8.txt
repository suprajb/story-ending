Portion of telepathic report of No. 67843, on Asteroid J-864A to No.
5463, on Terra:

"_As planned, I tested credulity of terrestrial minds by telling them
the true story of what happened on Ganymede._

_Found them capable of acceptance thereof._

_This proves that our idea of embedding ourselves within the flesh of
these terrestrial creatures was an excellent one and is essential to
the success of our plan. True, this is less simple than our method
on Ganymede, but we must continue to perform the operation upon each
terrestrial being as we take him over. Bracelets or other appendages
would arouse suspicion._

_There is no necessity in wasting a month here. I shall now take
command of the ship and return. We will report no ore present here. The
four of us who will animate the four terrestrials now aboard this ship
will report to you on Terra...._"
