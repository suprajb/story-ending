Upstairs in the little room in which stands the heroic and lost-looking
scientist, the door flies open. Cecile Douve, betrayer extraordinary,
hotcha extraordinary, flies into his arms.

"Darling, the hemisphere is cracking--he's winning out. What'll he do
to me?" All this excitedly. Then, ruminatively, almost sadly. "He won't
want to marry me now."

"Never fear, my sweetness," replies the chieftain of the four hundred
and ninety-nine. "We will win out. Earth science shall triumph. The
hemisphere is just makeshift, to hold him in one spot for a minute
or two. Earth'll really get going in a sec. Earth is insuperable.
Classicism he wanted and classicism he'll get. Remember the first
Achilles? He had a vulnerable spot. His heel!" The lost look was
replaced by a malevolent grin, sage and content. "Achilles Maravain
has a heel, too. It couldn't be protected by the force-wall, could it?
He doesn't walk on an inch of apparent nothingness does he? No. He's
vulnerable, just as his Homeric predecessor. And we don't have to use
clumsy poisoned arrows on this"--sneering emphasis--"heel." A wild
laugh. "We just throw a shot of good old electricity into him."

On the dais, the violent, raging figure of John Smith, alias Achilles
Maravain, colossus of the classics, exponent of the ages, Caesar
omnipotent, stiffens convulsively as a couple of hundred thousand volts
of electricity crisps his flesh. For a long moment, what is left of him
remains upright. Then, quietly it falls.

Achilles number two seeks out his illustrious predecessor in Elysia.
