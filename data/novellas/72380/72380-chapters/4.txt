Needless to say, I hurried to Eastport. But my trip was unnecessary. I
found Harold Marsden in a “private sanitarium” for the hopelessly
insane. There all day, and as far into the night as the opiates would
permit him, he is to be found seated before a radio set, the earphones
clamped to his head--listening. His statements, methodically filed away
by the head of the place, corresponded wildly with the prophecies of my
strange letter. Now he was listening to fragmentary messages from those
two he had seen precipitated into space, he maintained. Listening.

And they had disappeared, utterly. I found the large seal ring in the
inkwell on the desk. Also the slip in the hatband of the hat which had
been placed in the wall safe, unlocked. The postmaster remembered the
seals on the letter my cousin had mailed, and the approximate time he
had received it. I felt my own reason wavering.

That is why, fantastic as is the whole affair, I cannot yet bear the
sound of one of those radio loud speakers. It is when that inarticulate
sound they call “static” occurs, when fragments of words and sentences
seem to be painfully attempting to pierce a hostile medium,--that I
picture that hunched up figure with its spidery earphones,--listening.
Listening. For what?
