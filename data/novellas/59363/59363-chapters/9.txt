A dozen new Rollins Islanders showed up a few at a time in Carter's
helicopter. We've been working and waiting a long time now, waiting for
Carter to come back. For over a year now, our boat has made no crossing
to the mainland. Last night, over twenty-five miles of sea in clear
weather, we saw the sky lit by a great fire.

I haven't forgotten those rats. I dream about them, tearing one another
with bloody fangs.
