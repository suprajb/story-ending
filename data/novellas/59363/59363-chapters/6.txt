In a year's time, we had prospered. No richer land, due to the bird
droppings, was ever farmed. And the sandier areas could be depended
upon for melons and other crops demanding a lighter, drier, and not
so rich soil. Not only that, but we were five, now, instead of three.
The Jackson boys had lured a couple of husky girls to the island in the
boat. The boys claimed the women fell in love with them. I think they
fell in love with the island.

This fast work on the part of the Jacksons seemed a little rash to me.
I was still not at all sure we'd be allowed to remain and enjoy the
work we had done. Several times, I was tempted to use the radio again,
but decided to wait. I'm glad now I did.
