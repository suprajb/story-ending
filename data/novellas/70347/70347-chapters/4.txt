Ballard awoke feeling cramped and tired, as though he'd slept all
night in a bird cage. He looked at his chronometer, then at his
suit air-gauge. No. He'd been out only a few minutes. He got up and
crawled into the sleep-tank compartment and disconnected Walton's
awakener. Then he went into the control room and looked up the nearest
space-freighter lane in the radio call book, and set up an automatic
distress signal. He felt as if he were going to pass out again--this
time from sheer fatigue. There was still one thing more he wanted to do.

Out of the nose compartment he hauled a small case containing what had
caused all the trouble--

Then he crawled back out through the torn hull skin, opened the case
and flung every single one of the rotenite nuggets far out into space.
