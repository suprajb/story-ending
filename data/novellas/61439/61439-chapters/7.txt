struggled to sit up, but there was an incredible weight on his chest.

"Lie still," a voice said clearly, and his mind echoed, "Still ...
still ... still...."

liquid...." The weight was still there. He heard one last voice say,
"Poor guy, he must have run into scorpions."

Then he was lifted and it seemed as though the lifting would never
cease.
