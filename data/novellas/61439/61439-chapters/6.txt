It was when the time of cold was only a few degrees away that Xen felt
the heavy vibration which nearly made him dissolve with fear. It lasted
for a few degrees and then weakened and made only a small tremor. Now
many smaller vibrations reached him, like many creatures moving about.
The tremors spread out, moving slowly toward the rocky valley.

Xen lay still trying to identify the vibrations. They were not those of
Stings. As they approached, he recognized them as resembling in great
numbers the creature he had put upon the rock.
