Curt, lying in meager shade that would be gone in half an hour when
the third and largest sun rose, first saw the movement when it was on
the rocks. His already frayed nerves gave a frightened leap. He lay
perfectly still. Where he had seen the movement on the rocky shelf
there was now nothing.

The nothing moved forward.

Curt shivered. He was certain he was seeing nothing, and yet his eyes
were trying to tell him there was movement. When it reached the flat
place and flowed swiftly forward, he realized that it was a liquid
animal and was suddenly pointedly conscious of the weight of the pistol
against his hip.

He watched carefully for the eyes and the stinger, but saw none. That
frightened him. If he could not find the brain, he had no mark to
shoot at. As he watched, the liquid creature flowed against one of the
hardy, sun-browned plants and jerked in reaction. Instantly, it flowed
over the plant and absorbed it. The liquid turned momentarily a thin
brownish green and then cleared again.

Curt watched it with narrowed eyes. It was just possible that this
creature ate only plant life. The colonists had realized that the
liquid scorpions had fed upon something else before they arrived, but
no one had been able to discover what that something was.
