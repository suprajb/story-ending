under the rock to sear his already-burned flesh. He had to find more
shade.

Movements were very painful. His lips were cracking and his face had
blackened. The injured knee had swollen inside the protective suit; it
throbbed and ached. Dazedly, he pulled himself to his feet.

On the rock beside him, spread an inch thick, was the almost-invisible
creature he had been forced to circle in order to stop the liquid
scorpion. He wondered tiredly if it was dangerous. It lay completely
motionless, just as it had when the liquid scorpion had approached. So
it was probably more afraid of him than he was of it. He turned away.
There appeared to be shade down the valley--perhaps a mile, perhaps
three. Too much for him, he knew, but he set out, feeling the sun beat
cruelly at him, crying out when the pain in his knee forced him to
catch his balance against the sun-heated rock.

He knew without turning that the liquid creature was following him,
stopping when he stopped, starting when he started. When he knew he
could go no farther and felt his knee give weakly to his weight, he saw
it ooze forward and began to flow over his legs. He tried to reach his
pistol, but it seemed so far away.
