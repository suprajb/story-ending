When they turned the stranger over, the ants were already swarming in
his blood. At first they tried to brush them off with twigs, but more
and more ants came. The Russian pointed to the river and gestured that
it would be kindest to throw the body in. The Frenchman shook his head,
and the Englishman started to drag the body to the hole in the rocks.
They laid the stranger inside and rolled a rock against the entrance
and sealed the gaps with clay.

They missed him a great deal. Not only because of the fish and water.

Next day the Russian left them. Before going, he banged them on the
back and shook hands with them several times and tears left streaks on
his dirty face.
