Two days later a mud-stained, mold-encrusted hydrocar swung up to the
jetty at BeTaba, Venusian Colonial Headquarters on the outer edge of
Blue Swamp. Two haggard Earthmen climbed out, one still gripping a
Kamali mold gun, the other, his hands bound behind him.

They paced down the catwalk, entered the lock, and a moment later stood
before the Post Major. Simms saluted and began a graphic description of
all that had occurred.

"Post One needs help sir," he concluded. "There were twelve cases of
Mold Fever when I left, and the impentration walls are badly in need of
repair. The Kamalis are on the verge of an intertribal war."

The Major looked the prisoner over and nodded. All the defiance was
gone from Halleck now. He stood there, lips twisted in a sullen snarl,
eyes mirroring defeat.

"The I.P. men have been after this rat for a long time," the Major
said. "And now, Lieutenant, I'll have your official report."

Silently Simms handed the message cylinder across the desk.

The Major opened the cylinder and glanced at the scroll inside. A
moment passed in silence as he read the message.

"Lieutenant," he said at length, looking up, "how long have you been at
Post One?"

"Six weeks, sir."

The Major opened a humidor and took out a Martian cheroot. "It so
happens your Commandante is a very shrewd person. Lieutenant, take a
look at this letter."

Slowly Simms picked up the scroll and read:

... _and am sending this letter by Lieutenant Simms, a newcomer to Post
One. The boy had the usual case of nerves brought about by the damnable
solitude, the rain and the constant dangers here at the post, and I'm
taking the usual method of curing it. Let him rest over at BeTaba for a
month. Then send him back. He has the makings_ ...

And across the desk the Major puffed his Martian cheroot and smiled.
