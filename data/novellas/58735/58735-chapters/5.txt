The Tunn landed on Earth two miles out of Abilene, on December 15,
2042. A few hours after touching down, the Venusian delegation arrived
in the Earth capital and presented themselves at the Ministry of State.

The office worker who stood between them and the Secretary of the
Minister of Foreign Affairs was amused by the delegates' story. "Why
don't you kids go home and stop annoying us?" he said. "And stop
watching those TD shows!"

Ser Buldi indignantly repeated his request to see the Foreign Minister.

"Get out of here!" the office worker said in a tone that indicated he
was through talking to us.

Ser Buldi began to reply but he was silenced by Ser Alaga, who wished
to avoid any unnecessary incidents which could have proved embarrassing
to the Earthmen. Instead, the elder statesman approached a young lady
seated behind a desk.

"What can I do for you, little boy?" the girl asked with a smile.

Ser Alaga, with the aid of his hypno-tube, quickly convinced her to
admit the delegates to the office of the Sub-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs.

Then began a three day procession through the offices of many
sub-secretaries, four under-secretaries and two deputy ministers. In
each office our diplomats were received skeptically and passed on to
the next.

Finally, in desperation, the delegation released the survivors of the
Morning Star. Although Ser Alaga realized that their account of the
incident probably would be distorted, he knew that it would serve to
verify the delegation's identity.
