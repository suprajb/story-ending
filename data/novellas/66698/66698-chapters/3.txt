In order to avert panic, the world was alerted to the coming of the
Martians four days before the strange arrival.

They came.

Tall and thin with translucent skin and eyes that were almost
invisible, they were that small. There were four. Two men and two
women. The women's hair was as short as the men's. Their breasts made
slight bulges under their tunics.

It seemed they had listened in to radio broadcasts and spoke English,
French, Italian, Polish, and Spanish very well. They knew the Americas
was the strongest of the world governments and so had landed there. The
year, 1968, became a memorable year. The year when contact was made
with another planet.
