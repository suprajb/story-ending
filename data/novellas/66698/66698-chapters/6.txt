"Hello, General," Captain Shratt said, entering his office. He took off
his cap, tossed it on a leather chair, and went behind his desk.

"I've come from the president," the general said. "He says the time has
come."

"Good." Shratt sat down. "I wish I was coming along."

"You're needed here. What about this fellow Barnes? He knows an awful
lot."

"We've nothing to worry from him. Besides, once we've started there's
nothing anyone can do."

"Our fleet of Space ships is ready to take off within hours."

"It's best to wait till the Martian ship is well on its way. Then we
can start operations. When we get to Mars they'll be unprepared. Earth
will be supreme." Captain Shratt lit a cigarette. "Only Mars could have
stopped us if they'd decided to attack us. Now that threat is gone.
They won't know what hit them. Thanks to a playwright and his sense of
devotion to earth."
