It took only a few minutes to get to the village, but even so I was
tired. Lately it grew harder and harder to drive, to keep the trike
car on the narrow strip of pavement. I was glad when we pulled up in
the square and got out.

"I'll walk over to the plane with you," Emery said. "I've got plenty
of time."

"All right."

"By the way, Lewis, Jenny and I and some of the neighbors thought we'd
drop over on your anniversary."

"That's fine," I said, trying to sound enthusiastic. "Come on over."

"It's a big event," he said. "Deserves a celebration."

The shuttle plane was just landing. I hurried over to the ticket
window, with him right beside me.

"I just wanted to be sure you'd be home," he said. "We wouldn't want
you to miss your own party."

"Party?" I said. "But John--"

He wouldn't even let me finish protesting.

"Now don't ask any questions, Lewis. You wouldn't want to spoil the
surprise, would you?"

He chuckled. "Your plane's loading now. You'd better be going. Thanks
for the ride, Lewis."

I went across to the plane and got in. I hoped that somehow we
wouldn't have to spend that Martian anniversary being congratulated
and petted and babied. I didn't think Martha could stand it. But there
wasn't any polite way to say no.
