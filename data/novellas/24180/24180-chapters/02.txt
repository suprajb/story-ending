As Stan tossed his books on his bunk, Jak Holme raised his head and
looked across the cell.

"More of them books?"

"Yeah." Stan nodded. "Still trying to find out about this planet."

"You trying to be some kinda big politician when you get out?" Holme
snorted.

"Tell you, be better you try mixing with the guys, 'stead of pushing
'em around with that fancy talk, making 'em jump now and then, see.
You get along with 'em, you'll see. They'll tell you all you need. Be
working with some of 'em, too, remember?"

"Oh, I don't try to push anybody around." Stan perched on his bunk.
"Doesn't hurt anyone to study, though."

"Oh, sure." Holme grimaced. "Do you a lot of good, too. Guy's working
on some production run, it helps a lot he knows why all them big guys
in the history books did them things, huh?" He laughed derisively.

"Sure it does! What they want, you should make that fabricator spit
out nice parts, see?" He swelled his chest.

"Now me, I got my mind on my business, see. I get out of here, I
oughta make out pretty good." He looked around the cell.

"Didn't get no parole, see, so I get all the training. Real good
trained machinist now, and I'm gonna walk out of here clean. Get a job
down at the space-yards.

"Machinist helper, see? Then, soon's I been there a while, I'll get my
papers and go contract machinist. Real good money. Maybe you'd do
better, you try that."
