"They've opened a branch office in New York," I said carefully into the
phone, a few weeks later.

With my pencil, very carefully, I extended the membership curve from
where it was then.

After the next doubling, the curve went almost straight up and off the
page.

Allowing for a lag of contagion from one nation to another, depending
on how much their citizens intermingled, I'd give the rest of the world
about twelve years.

There was a long silence while Caswell probably drew the same graph
in his own mind. Then he laughed weakly. "Well, you asked me for a
demonstration."

That was as good an answer as any. We got together and had lunch in a
bar, if you can call it lunch. The movement we started will expand by
hook or by crook, by seduction or by bribery or by propaganda or by
conquest, but it will expand. And maybe a total world government will
be a fine thing--until it hits the end of its rope in twelve years or
so.

What happens then, I don't know.

But I don't want anyone to pin that on me. From now on, if anyone asks
me, I've never heard of Watashaw.
