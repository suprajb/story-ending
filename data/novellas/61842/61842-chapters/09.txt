McNeally stepped back, torn between dread and doubt. He shook his head
at us. "It's no use. He's completely mad."

Then Russ Bartlett cried, "Wait! _Listen!_"

For Cartaphilus, his face worn and aged, had bowed his head as
though surrendering to forces greater than his will-to-die. And he

reverse the polarity of the alternate hypatomic motors. Transmit the
counter electromotive force helically through the forward coils.
Use full power. Keep all motors running at top speed. Cut out the
intercommunicating and lighting systems; there must be no D.C. current
in operation anywhere on the ship. The cross-currents will--"

Chief Engineer Lester's face was a masque of blank dismay. He husked,
"A hysteresis bloc! It might work. Nobody ever thought of it before."

"What do you mean?" That was Cap McNeally.

"His suggestion. Heterodyning the web-coils, so we'll counter the
H-layer radiation with an alternating current of our own. It's just
about one chance in a million!"

"Then take that chance!" cried the skipper. "Try it! Do as he says.
And, for God's sake, man, _hurry_!"

Cartaphilus, his eyes drained of all expression, rose sluggishly. Once
