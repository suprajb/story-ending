We held court on Donaldson that night, and he made full confession.
That first day, he had stumbled over an alien treasure in the cave
beyond the hill--that, and the thought-converter. The idea came to him
that perhaps, as sole survivor of the expedition, he could turn some of
the treasure to his own uses.

So he utilized the thought-converter in a campaign to pick us off
one by one without aiming suspicion at himself. Only his clumsy way
of pretending to see the creature himself had given him away; else he
might have killed us all.

Our rulebook gave no guide on what to do about him--but we reached a
decision easily enough.

When we left Pollux V, taking with us samples of the treasure, and
other specimens of the long-dead race (including the thought-converter)
we left Donaldson behind, on the bare, lifeless planet, with about a
week's supply of food and air.

No one ever learned of his treachery. We listed him as a casualty,
along with Max and Leo, when we returned to Earth. The Exploratory
Wing had too noble a name to tarnish by revealing what Donaldson had
done ... and none of us will ever speak the truth. The Wing means too
much to us for that.

And I think they're going to award him a posthumous medal....
