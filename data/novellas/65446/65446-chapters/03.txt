We stayed. We spent the rest of that day aboard ship, having called off
the day's explorations in memory of Max. The bright orb of Pollux set
about 2000 ship time, and the sky was filled with a glorious sight: a
horde of moons whirling above. The moons of Pollux V were incredible.

There were _one hundred_ of them, ranging in size from a hunk of rock
the size of Mars' Deimos to one massive high-albedo satellite almost
a thousand miles in diameter. They marched across the sky in stately
order, filling the Polluxian night with brightness.

Only we didn't feel much sense of wonder. We buried Max in a crude
grave, laid him to rest under the light of a hundred moons, and then
withdrew to the ship to consider our problem.

"Where'd it come from?" Doc Graves asked.

"Nowhere," I said. "Just nowhere. One second it wasn't there, next
second it was. It vanished the same way."

"How could that be?" Donaldson asked. "Matter doesn't work that way;
it's flatly impossible."

Holding myself in check, I said, "Maybe so, Donaldson. But the thing
was _there_."

"How do you know?" the anthropologist persisted, sneering a little.
"You sure it wasn't a mass illusion of some kind?"

"Damn you," Forster shouted, "_You_ weren't there. We were--and we saw
it. _Max_ saw it. Ask _Max_ if it was there!"

Evenly, Donaldson said, "On the basis of your description, I'm
convinced it must have been an illusion. I'm willing to go out there
and have a look first thing in the morning--either alone or with any of
you, if you can work up the courage. Fair enough?"

"Fair enough," I said. "I'll go with you."
