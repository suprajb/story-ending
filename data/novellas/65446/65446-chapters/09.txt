It was just the two of us, there in the cabin. I heard fists pounding
on the door from outside, but I ignored them. This was between me and
Donaldson.

"What is that thing?" I asked, facing him, tugging at his throat. I
shook him. "Where'd you find that hell-thing?"

"Wouldn't you like to know?" he wheezed.

My fingers tightened. Suddenly he drew up his foot and lashed out at
my stomach. I let go of his throat and fell back, the wind knocked out
of me. As I staggered backward, he darted for the fallen box, but I
recovered and brought my foot down hard on his outstretched hand.

He snarled in pain. I felt his other fist crash into my stomach again.
I was almost numb, sick, ready to curl up in a knot and close my eyes.
But I forced myself to suck in breath and hit him.

His head snapped back. I hit him again, and he reeled soggily. His
neat, precise lips swelled into a bloody mass. His fists moved hazily;
I blackened one of his eyes, and he groaned and slumped. Fury was in my
fists; I was avenging the honor of the Exploratory Wing against the
one man who had broken its oaths.

"Enough ... enough...."

But I hit him again and again, till he sagged to the floor. I picked up
the black metal box, fondled it in my hands. Then, tentatively, I threw
a thought at it.

_Monster._

The monster appeared in all its ugliness.

_Vanish._

It vanished.

"That's how it works, isn't it?" I said. "It's a thought projector.
That monster never existed outside your own mind, Donaldson."

"Don't hit me again," he whined. I didn't. He was beneath contempt.

I threw open the door and saw the other crewmen huddled outside, their
faces pale. "It's all over," I said. "Here's your monster."

I held out the black box.
