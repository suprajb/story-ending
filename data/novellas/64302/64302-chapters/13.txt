The dense hordes of enthusiastic insect warriors ignored Ward as he
crawled to the cage. Nothing remained of Red except his clothing,
shredded, and a few bits of tendons on which mercenaries still fed
ferociously. And a tattered copy of an ancient Twentieth Century
thriller called “Hounds of the Void.”

High overhead, a direct beam of sunlight filtered down through the
spiraling vapor, glinted on sheeny wings, as Ward sprawled out on
the hard, cold stone. He would make it all right now. There would be
evidence now to clear him of his psycho label, and the Mo-Sanshon would
be wiped out. But Red was gone. Red, the Adventurer.

Ward wondered why it hadn’t occurred to him before. He, an
entomologist, too. But the pronunciation had fooled him. The sharp
accent on the “i” had distorted its true significance. Spelled out,
Formica meant ANT, of course.

RED ANT.
