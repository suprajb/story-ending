A scream of hate and fear rang through the colossal cavern beneath the
Martian deserts. Ward turned, his eyes dimmed. It was Red. Somewhere
he had gotten hold of an electronic blaster and had paused, blasted
the centipede, and was now running on across the cavern. He held the
levitated cage easily in one hand.

He waved the gun at Ward and his thin face smiled. He stopped half way
between Ward and the towering translucent bowl that housed the Queen
Mother of the Mo-Sanshon. But the normal pulsing of the giant breeding
brain was visibly agitated now. It shivered in pounding undulations.
Waves of frantic force emanated from its throbbing bulk.

Ward saw the woman-creature beside him lean forward, her hands
trembling. Her voice was a bit higher, that was all. “You! You live,
Molakh! You were dead!”

Red laughed as he unfastened the cage door. It was a drawn taut laugh,
without mirth. Ward yelled, “Red! I understand now! Don’t open it!
Suicide if you--”

Red’s face was a mask of hate and conflicting emotions in the yellow
glow. The make-up was almost all gone, giving his face a ragged, weird
aspect.

“Right, Doc,” he said. “A radical male. A revolting male. We get them
every once in a while here. There are many kinds of mutation. They
use them for experimentation in the laboratories. You should see the
laboratories here, Doc, with bugs secreting chemicals and living bodies
as test tubes. I was one of their recent experiments with humanoid
duplication. They thought they had disposed of me, but I eluded them.
I’m a slippery individual, you know. I found out about your work and
knew you were right, and I decided to help you. Only I could have
helped you, Doc. Thanks, Doc, for the adventure. You’ll never know what
it means to feel the grandeur of the stars--you’ve never been a myopic
bug.”
