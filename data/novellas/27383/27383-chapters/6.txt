Willy strained and twisted, trying to reclaim his arm from the
policeman's grip.

"Honest, you guys. I didn't know it was against the law. Aw, I figgered
it was against the rules mebbe to send in somebody else's answers, but
we wuz only makin' a joke, Oscar 'n' me. Oscar's the one who actual put
it in the mailbox and stole the stamp! I bet he's the one you're after!"

"Now calm down, Willy," the beefy policeman coaxed. "No one's broken any
law. Nobody's under arrest. We just want to chat a minute with whoever
it was filled out that test."

"Yeh, Willy," the second policeman broke in, "if you didn't do it, and I
believe you when you say you didn't, then who did?"

"What's it to ya?" Willy asked, his mouth twitching nervously.

The first policeman glanced at the second and then back at Willy. "Well,
it's like this, Willy," he said. "Whoever filled out those answers got
every one of them right. The people who run the contest want to meet
the guy, see? And they asked us to help find him because we know you
people better than anyone else does. See? That's all!"

"Yeh," said the second. "That's all. Now who did it?"

Willy stood with his jaw drooping for a moment. "You mean he got ever'
last one of 'em right?" he asked. "Freddy was always braggin' about his
brains, but me 'n' Oscar figgered he was makin' most of it up."

"Freddy who? Freddy the Fish you mean?"

"Yeh, Freddy." Willy perked up and turned toward Freddy's bench. "Hey,
Freddy! Hey, you know that test you took in the newspaper that you
didn't know I sent in? You won the contest or sumpin'! Hey, that's
great!"
