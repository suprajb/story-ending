"That was a pretty good idea of mine, about advertising in the paper,
wasn't it, Mr. Jones?" Dwindle, America's Number One Personnel
Specialist, asked his surly assistant.

"Yes, Dwindle."

Jones stared gloomily out the fourteenth story window into the park,
where the local bums were loafing and sleeping and feeding peanuts to
the pigeons. He was nauseated with the prospect of having to address his
new boss as "Mr. Dwindle," and was toying with the idea of abandoning
his specialty completely to join the ranks of the happy, carefree
unemployed. He watched as two uniformed policemen approached one of the
less wholesome-appearing characters.

"No, I don't suppose I could tolerate being in and out of jail every
week on a vagrancy charge," he told himself. But then he smiled bitterly
as he thought of the strange parallel between the policemen arresting
the bum and other officials, elsewhere in the United States, tapping
respectable citizens on the shoulder at this very moment.

"Dwindle, do you really think it was wise to issue warrants to arrest
all those persons who scored perfect on the first test? How many did you
say there were?"

"Only a hundred or so," Dwindle smiled sweetly. "And besides, they're
not being arrested. General Marcher explained to you that they are being
drafted into the service of the government. Honestly, sometimes I think
you worry too much."

Jones turned back to the window, brooding over Dwindle's transformation.
"Maybe so," he sighed, watching the newly-arrested vagrant pointing an
accusing finger toward one of the other bums.
