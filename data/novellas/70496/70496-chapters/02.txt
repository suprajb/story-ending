The Examiner for the Board of Life waited while Donovan dressed. The
answer could already be seen in the official's eyes.

"No?"

"I'm sorry," the Examiner said, "but the laws of the Komitet are
fairly stringent. Only those whose social value is above Par 195 may
be rejuvenated. Not much value is placed upon engineers and Trust
managers who can easily be replaced from each year's Birth Quota. The
application is denied, and there's no use appealing it."

"It's unjust!" Donovan exclaimed, ignoring the alarming pain in
his failing heart. "All I want is ten more years--not even a full
return to youth! If there's no room on Home Planet, let me go the
extra-terrestials or even some asteroid. I'll make any contribution
required to...."

The Examiner, who had often heard such vain pleas, rapped his desk
with the blood-analyscope. "The Komitet is far too wise to permit
socially unnecessary extensions of the life span, just as it does not
permit unlicensed time travel. What would happen if we allowed you
to be rejuvenated, and then permitted extra-terrestial emigration?
There would be millions of old or sick people like you demanding
equal treatment and equal consideration. Before long the planets
and asteroids would be overpopulated and independent colonies set
up thereon which would eventually come in conflict with the Home
Planet Komitet. No, my friend, the Komitet is wise in decreeing that
rejuvenation and human birth are mutually contradictory. Rather than
sacrifice birth, with the consequent stagnation of the human species,
the Komitet has decided rigidly to control youth-extensions, and grants
those periods of additional life only to the socially valuable."

"Yes," Donovan said bitterly, "the Komitet keeps itself immortal while
the rest of us have to die."

The Examiner's voice was hard. "Shall I denounce you to the C.D.?"

"I beg forgiveness," Donovan said; "your decision is a just one and I
shall make no appeal."
