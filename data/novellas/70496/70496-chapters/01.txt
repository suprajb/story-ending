Donovan stood up, and when the C.D. agent left he frantically sent out
a conscious call to Blascomb's thought-frequency number.

"By the Komitet!" Blascomb's wave-induced voice rang in Donovan's
ears, "I told you never to call me unless it was most urgent."

"This is urgent," Donovan thought desperately, "Crane, a C.D. agent,
was here a minute ago. He's going to look over the books of the Trust."

"He won't find a thing," Blascomb's thoughts were confident in
Donovan's mind, "They haven't caught a single one of the men I've sent

"Then hurry. My heart's in bad shape and I can't last much longer. I'm
practically being kept alive by that rotten Callistan serum."

"Stay alive for one more week," Blascomb thought encouragingly, "and

_Turn backward, turn backward, O Time in thy flight!_ The song sped

him your escape will be arranged to throw suspicion upon him. We will
make it seem that your brother-in-law killed you for denouncing him

safe--perhaps forever."

His brother-in-law's life was a cheap price to pay for youth. Donovan
stared at his stiff, corpse-like hands. All he needed was one more
week. He would make one more effort to secure a Life-Extension--and
then....
