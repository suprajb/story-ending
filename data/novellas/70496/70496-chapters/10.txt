Donovan stepped into O'Sloane's office. Practically nothing had been
touched as yet, for one of the staff editors had just begun to sort a
pile of stacked papers from several cabinets. Donovan recognized the
original manuscript of "Turn Backward, O Time!" upon the desk, and
hurriedly skimmed through the pages. The description was intact, and
while he could not remember why such a machine would work, he knew that
it could be built and he could escape.

With a sigh he pocketed the manuscript and introduced himself to the
young editor who would probably succeed O'Sloane upon his death.

"Oh yes," the editor with the curious thin smile said, "I have heard
quite a bit about you, and have been waiting a long time for this
meeting. We've met before, you know."

"Really?" Donovan said. The face did appear familiar, but he could not
recall the occasion.

"My name is Edel W. Crane, C.D."

Donovan felt a cold tremor of fear shake his body.

He moistened his lips.

"What do the letters C.D. stand for?"

The pasty-faced young man closed and then locked the door of the
office. Walking towards Donovan, the smile no longer there, he told
him. Then he did what he had come to do.
