SEN. KUELL: I submit, colonel, that your reasoning is defective. I
submit furthermore that it is not the sort of reasoning which normal
well-adjusted Americans indulge in, and I hereby recommend to this
committee that both yours and Commander Perkins' qualifications be
reexamined at the earliest possible opportunity and that both of you be
relieved from duty until such time as it can satisfactorily be proven
that both of you have recovered from your hallucinatory experience.

LT. COL. GREAVES: But the scrolls I brought back aren't hallucinatory,
senator. Neither is the fragment of--of--yes, of gopherwood. And
certainly the photograph is real enough.

SEN. KUELL: Granted. But I have grave doubts about some of the other
items you have called to our attention. I'm afraid you're going to be
in for a rather rude awakening, Colonel Greaves, when Dr. Noyes and his
staff finish deciphering the scrolls. Gopherwood indeed!

SEN. LARCH: Excuse me, senator. I have just been handed a telegram from
Dr. Noyes. It--it would appear that they have deciphered the scrolls
already. I will read the telegram aloud: 'Deep Space Scrolls prove
Spaceship X to be Noah's Ark beyond vestige of a doubt--Noyes'.

_An extended silence._
