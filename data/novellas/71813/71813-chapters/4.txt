The thought of television reminded him of the money, and the questions.
The air and an occasional swim, and the food, had all combined to give
him a feeling of health and relaxation. He felt supremely confident;
he knew he could cope with the questions. And the time must be growing
short. The plane should be arriving any day.

Don suddenly realized that he had stopped shaving some time before,
and that he had fallen into the habit of not wearing a shirt. He
shaved, and discovered that he had only two clean shirts left. He also
discovered that the freezer was nearly empty, but he remembered seeing
a number of plants growing near the house; if the freezer should run
out before the plane arrived, he could grow something, he thought.

But the freezer did not run out of supplies. Instead, the generator
stopped. It was out of gas.

Draining the last of the melted ice from the box, Don suddenly became
aware of a simple fact. There should have been enough gas. The tank had
been quite full enough to last more than the two months. He suddenly
realized that he had completely lost count of days, and that the plane
might be overdue by as much as a week or two.

Feeling a slight panic, he began to check back through his daily stacks
of writing. He found that he had done an average of eight pages every
day, which gave him a means of counting back. But it was only a rough
estimate, since there had been off days.

Still, the count came out to at least three months. The plane was very
definitely overdue.
