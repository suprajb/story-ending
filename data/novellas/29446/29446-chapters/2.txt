The two would sit on the packing case and watch the stars. They would

In time, Mark built more complicated conversations into Charles. He
couldn't give the robot free choice, of course, but he managed a pretty

"The thing I don't understand," Mark would say, "is why a man like you
wants to live here. I mean, it's all right for me. No one cares about
me, and I never gave much of a damn about anyone. But why you?"

girl named Martha, whom neither of us ever met. And that's a pity. But
friendship remains, and the eternal night."
