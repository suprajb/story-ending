Ten minutes later the great shadowy sphere that was the Saturn
mainland was shrinking in the distance. Ahead, through the plane's
front view-plate, the Ring arced across the heavens, a pastel rainbow
against the outer night. Night here was never complete blackness; the
Ring's sprinkling of radium moons gave a glow one could read by even at
midnight.

Ten minutes more and he abruptly threw the ship into a shuddering
bank, skirted a looming planetoid, dived to a precarious landing on
its neighbor. He dragged a spare radio set from under his seat and with
it in his hand jumped out of the ship and ran to a large tree on which
one end of a heavy cable was tied.

The other end of the cable stretched up and away from the planetoid
and out across the misty void--to the neighboring globe which was so
heavily jungled that there was no place to land a plane. Flint climbed
into the dangling cable chair, holding the radio in his lap, and pushed
himself out across the wire, away from the planetoid, over the sheer
drop ten miles under his feet.

Seconds later--things happened fast with this feather gravity--the
other world moved up under him and he dropped lightly to its surface.

The trail he took through the woods was more like a tunnel, and the
little clearing that soon appeared was like a well, the moon lights
filtering through.
